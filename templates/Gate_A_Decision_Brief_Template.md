## Decision Context

### What Are We Deciding?

- [ ] **GO** - Proceed to MVP build and pilot with recommended segment
- [ ] **PIVOT** - Change direction based on invalidated hypothesis (see pivot options)

### Decision Criteria

**GO Requirements:**
1. ≥80% of critical hypotheses at Medium or High confidence
2. No invalidated critical hypotheses without viable pivot
3. Clear MVP scope aligned to validated needs
4. Acceptable risk level in ecosy acceptance and feasibility
5. Path to viability (business model) credible even if not fully validated

**PIVOT Triggers:**
1. ≥1 critical hypothesis invalidated
2. Better opportunity discovered in adjacent space
3. Unacceptable risk in acceptability or feasibility that requires different approach

**STOP Triggers:**
1. <50% of critical hypotheses at Medium+ confidence after reasonable validation effort
2. Problem not validated as real or significant
3. No viable business model identified
4. Team capability gaps cannot be filled
5. Ethical or legal barriers insurmountable

## Questions for Discussion

### Strategic Questions

1. **[Question 1]** - Example: "Given Medium confidence on ecosystem acceptability, should we derisk this before MVP or validate in pilot?"

2. **[Question 2]** - Example: "If pilot shows strong product-market fit but economics are marginal, do we pivot business model or iterate product?"

3. **[Question 3]** - Example: "What is our risk tolerance for regulatory uncertainty while we await medical board guidance?"

### Tactical Questions

1. **[Question 1]** - Example: "Should we pilot with 5 clinics in-depth or 15 clinics at surface level?"

2. **[Question 2]** - Example: "Who should own the partnership discussions with health systems - CEO or dedicated BD hire?"

3. **[Question 3]** - Example: "Can we accelerate timeline by using third-party EHR integration service instead of building in-house?"
