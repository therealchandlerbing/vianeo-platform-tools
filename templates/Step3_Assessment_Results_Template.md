## Overall Weighted Score Calculation

**Formula:**
Overall Score = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

**Calculation:**
- Legitimacy: [#.#] × 0.15 = [#.##]
- Desirability: [#.#] × 0.25 = [#.##]
- Acceptability: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]
- Feasibility: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]
- Viability: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]

**Total:** [#.##] (rounds to **[#.#]**)

| 3.0-3.4 | **Developing** | Conditional proceed, address gaps |
| 2.0-2.9 | **Problematic** | Reassess assumptions, pivot likely |
| <2.0 | **Non-viable** | Consider pivot or validation sprint |

**This Project:** [#.#] - **[Category]** - [Recommendation]

1. **Do NOT deliver this markdown to the user** - Convert to properly formatted DOCX
2. **Ensure all tables are clean** - No markdown syntax (|, -, *) in final DOCX
3. **Apply color coding** - Scores and backgrounds should be color-coded per specifications
4. **Maintain professional appearance** - This goes to investment committees
5. **Keep concise** - Justifications should be 2-3 sentences maximum
6. **Cite all evidence** - Every score ≥3 must have Evidence IDs
7. **Specify gaps for scores 1-2** - Say exactly what evidence is needed
