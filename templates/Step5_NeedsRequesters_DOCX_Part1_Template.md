Problem Statement (from Legitimacy)

Cognitive decline threatens independence for aging populations. Current solutions either inaccessible (clinical-grade tools) or unvalidated (app-only). 35.9% of cognitive searches from adults seeking prevention, but no affordable real-time measurement exists.

Field of Application

Cognitive health & wellness for aging populations (55-75)

Business Model Canvas

Status: Draft available. Customer segments and value propositions complete. Revenue streams and cost structure still under development.

Interview/Research Data Status

23 customer discovery interviews completed across 5 segments (8 research labs, 7 manufacturers, 5 strategic sector buyers, 3 3D printing providers). Average interview length 52 minutes. Transcripts available. Market sizing from USGS Rare Earth Elements report (2024) and Brazil trade statistics (MDIC 2023-2024).

## Section 2: REQUESTERS TABLE

**Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
REQUESTERS TABLE
```

**Introduction Text:** (11pt, Regular)
```
The following table identifies 6-10 distinct requester roles for this solution, with descriptions of who they are and reliability of validation evidence.
```

**Table Format:**

**Table Style:** Light Grid - Accent 1 (or equivalent professional style)

**Column Headers:**
- Font: 11pt, Bold, White text
- Background: #2E5C8A (blue)
- Padding: 6pt all sides
- Borders: All borders, 1pt, #2E5C8A

**Column Widths:**
- Column 1 (Requester Role): 2.5"
- Column 2 (Description): 3.5"
- Column 3 (Reliability): 2.0"

**Cell Format:**
- Font: 11pt, Regular
- Padding: 6pt all sides
- Alignment: Left (for all columns)
- Vertical alignment: Top
- Borders: All borders, 0.5pt, #CCCCCC

**Row Shading (optional but recommended):**
- Alternating rows: White, very light gray (#F8F9FA)

**Example Table:**

| Requester Role | Description | Reliability |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Research Labs & Universities | Academic and government research institutions exploring rare earth magnet innovations. Primarily focused on 3D printing applications, novel alloy compositions, and prototype development. Scale: 10-15 major institutions in Brazil (USP, UFRJ, IPEN, CDTN). Lower price sensitivity but require high customization. | Less than 5 interviewed [validate with interviews] |
| Permanent Magnet Manufacturers | Companies producing finished NdFeB magnets for industrial applications. Currently import raw powders from China/Japan. Serve as critical intermediary between raw materials and end-use sectors. Scale: small to medium Brazilian manufacturers facing supply chain vulnerability. | Not yet interviewed [validate with interviews] |

**Table Notes (11pt, Italic, after table):**
```
Note: Reliability ratings indicate validation status. "More than 5 interviewed" = strong evidence base. "Not yet interviewed" = hypothesis requiring validation through primary research.

## Section 3: NEEDS ANALYSIS

**Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
NEEDS ANALYSIS
```

**Introduction Text:** (11pt, Regular)
```
The following 10 needs represent what requesters need to accomplish (Tasks), problems they need to eliminate (Pains), and outcomes they desire (Expectations). Each need is limited to 60 characters for clarity.
```

**Subsection Headers:** (12pt, Bold, Color: #17A2B8)
```
Tasks (What They Need to Accomplish)
Pains (Problems to Eliminate)
Expectations (Desired Outcomes)
```

**List Format:**
- Bullet style: Solid round bullets
- Font: 11pt, Regular
- Spacing: 6pt after each item
- Bold the need statement itself

**Example:**

**Tasks (What They Need to Accomplish)**

• **Access cost-competitive domestic raw materials**
• **Enable 3D printing applications with spherical powders**
• **Customize powder specifications for specific applications**
• **Establish reliable supply chain for magnet production**

**Pains (Problems to Eliminate)**

• **Eliminate dependency on Chinese/Japanese imports**
• **Reduce vulnerability to geopolitical trade disruptions**
• **Avoid long lead times from international suppliers**
• **Minimize exposure to volatile international pricing**

**Expectations (Desired Outcomes)**

• **Achieve strategic sovereignty in critical materials**
• **Support domestic manufacturing ecosystem development**
• **Enable circular economy through recycling integration**

## Section 4: EXISTING SOLUTIONS

**Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
EXISTING SOLUTIONS
```

**Introduction Text:** (11pt, Regular)
```
The following table maps the competitive landscape, including direct competitors, indirect alternatives, and the "doing nothing" status quo. Limitations explain why existing solutions fail to fully meet requester needs.
```

**Table Format:**

**Table Style:** Light Grid - Accent 1 (or equivalent professional style)

**Column Headers:**
- Font: 11pt, Bold, White text
- Background: #17A2B8 (teal)
- Padding: 6pt all sides
- Borders: All borders, 1pt, #17A2B8

**Column Widths:**
- Column 1 (Solution): 2.0"
- Column 2 (Description): 3.0"
- Column 3 (Limitations Identified): 3.0"

**Cell Format:**
- Font: 11pt, Regular
- Padding: 6pt all sides
- Alignment: Left (for all columns)
- Vertical alignment: Top
- Borders: All borders, 0.5pt, #CCCCCC

**Special Formatting for "Doing Nothing" Row:**
- Background: Very light yellow (#FFFACD)
- This highlights the status quo as a real competitor

**Example Table:**

| Solution | Description | Limitations Identified |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Chinese/Japanese Suppliers (Dominant Players) | Established global suppliers (primarily China) providing dense NdFeB alloy powders to Brazilian manufacturers. Dominant market solution with mature supply chains and competitive pricing due to economies of scale. | Trade barriers intensifying due to geopolitical tensions. No customization for Brazilian specifications. Supply chain vulnerable to export controls. Prices subject to international market volatility. No circular economy/recycling integration. |
| Conventional High-Temperature Production | Standard powder metallurgy using high-temperature methods. Produces dense, irregular powders suitable for conventional sintering. Well-established technology with decades of refinement. | Cannot produce spherical morphology required for 3D printing applications. Limited flexibility for customization. High energy consumption. Environmental concerns with traditional processes. |
| Doing Nothing (Import Dependency Status Quo) | Organizations continue relying entirely on imported NdFeB powders and finished magnets. Current state for majority of Brazilian manufacturers and institutions. Inaction remains a choice. | Strategic vulnerability to trade disruptions. No control over specifications or pricing. Technology dependence on foreign suppliers. Incompatible with Brazil's strategic sovereignty goals. Limits domestic innovation in magnet applications. |

**Table Notes (11pt, Italic, after table):**
```
Note: "Doing Nothing" is included as a real competitive alternative. If status quo is adequate, small improvements won't overcome switching costs.
