## Overall Weighted Score Calculation

**Formula:**
Overall Score = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

**Calculation:**
- Legitimacy: [#.#] × 0.15 = [#.##]
- Desirability: [#.#] × 0.25 = [#.##]
- Acceptability: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]
- Feasibility: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]
- Viability: [#.#] × 0.20 = [#.##]

**Total:** [#.##] (rounds to **[#.#]**)

**Category:** [Strong 4.5-5.0 / Promising 3.5-4.4 / Developing 3.0-3.4 / Problematic 2.0-2.9 / Non-viable <2.0]

**Threshold Analysis:**
- Overall Score ≥ 3.2: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL]
- Legitimacy ≥ 3.0: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL]
- Desirability ≥ 3.5: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL] ← HIGHEST BAR
- Acceptability ≥ 3.0: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL]
- Feasibility ≥ 3.0: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL]
- Viability ≥ 3.0: [✓ PASS / ✗ FAIL]

## Critical Red Flags

[List any patterns of scores = 1 that represent fatal flaws. Reference specific red flag patterns from VIANEO framework:]

### 🚨 Pattern 1: No Customer Validation
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews with users)
- Q13 = 1 (problem not validated by stakeholders)
- Q22 = 1 (value proposition not tested)

**Status:** [PRESENT / NOT PRESENT]

**If Present:** STOP building. START customer discovery immediately. Without validated demand, you're building something nobody wants.

---

### 🚨 Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness
- Q3 = 1 (no ecosystem map)
- Q17 = 1 (no resistance identified)
- Multiple critical ecosystem actors rated as unfavorable with no mitigation

**Status:** [PRESENT / NOT PRESENT]

**If Present:** Map ecosystem and assess acceptability before investing further. You may face unexpected barriers that make success impossible.

---

### 🚨 Pattern 3: Business Model Untested
- Q14 = 1 (revenue model undefined)
- Q19 = 1 (pricing not tested with customers)
- Q27 = 1 (can't articulate value proposition)

**Status:** [PRESENT / NOT PRESENT]

**If Present:** Define and test revenue model immediately. Great product ≠ sustainable business. Investors need path to profitability.

---

### 🚨 Pattern 4: Resource Constraints
- Q1 = 1 (lacking necessary resources)
- Q16 = 1 (no committed team)
- Team is all part-time or volunteer

**Status:** [PRESENT / NOT PRESENT]

**If Present:** Secure committed resources before proceeding. You cannot execute without the fundamentals in place.

**Assessment Version:** 1.0
**Template Version:** Step 3 Market Maturity Assessment
**Framework:** VIANEO 8-Step Business Model Evaluation System
**Completed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Next Review:** [YYYY-MM-DD - typically 30-90 days]

---

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

1. **All scores ≥3 must cite specific Evidence IDs** - No vague "some evidence" claims
2. **All scores of 1 must specify exactly what evidence is needed** - No generic "needs validation"
3. **Evidence quality matters** - Only L3 (external validated) evidence supports scores ≥3
4. **This is a snapshot** - Scores will change as validation work proceeds
5. **Use with Gate A** - This assessment informs formal go/pivot/stop decisions
6. **Character limits** - When creating DOCX outputs, maintain professional formatting within reasonable length (Assessment Results: 2-3 pages, Dimension Analysis: 4-6 pages)
