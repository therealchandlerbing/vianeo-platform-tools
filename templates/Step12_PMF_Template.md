## Solution Configuration (from Feasibility - Step 11)

### MVP Features (Must Have)

Features critical for minimum viable product:

| Feature Name | Timeline | Needs Covered | Validation Level | MVP Rationale |
|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| [Feature 1 name] | Already available | [Need 1, Need 2] | >5 interviewed | [Why this is MVP: covers fundamental need X, enables core value] |
| [Feature 2 name] | Short term (0-6 mo) | [Need 3] | >5 interviewed | [Why this is MVP] |
| [Feature 3 name] | Short term | [Need 4, Need 5] | <5 interviewed | [Why this is MVP despite lower validation] |

[Continue for 6-10 MVP features]

**MVP Features Summary**:
- **Total MVP Features**: [Number] *(target: 6-10)*
- **Available Now**: [Count]
- **Short-term (0-6 mo)**: [Count]
- **Mid-term (6-18 mo)**: [Count if any in MVP]
- **High Validation (>5)**: [Count]/[Total]

**MVP Coverage Check**:
- [ ] All fundamental needs have at least one MVP feature ✓
- [ ] All MVP features map to fundamental or important needs ✓
- [ ] MVP size is 6-10 features ✓
- [ ] Majority (>50%) of MVP features have >5 interviews validation ✓

---

### Additional Features (Phased - Post-MVP)

Features deferred to later phases:

| Feature Name | Timeline | Needs Covered | Validation Level | Phasing Rationale |
|--------------|----------|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| [Feature X] | Mid term (6-18 mo) | [Need 6] | >5 interviewed | [Why phased: important not fundamental, requires additional validation] |
| [Feature Y] | Long term (18+ mo) | [Need 7] | Not interviewed | [Why phased: secondary need, low validation, future enhancement] |

[Continue for 0-5 phased features]

---

### Configuration Rationale

**Why This Feature Set?**

[Paragraph 1: Core Value Focus - 3-4 sentences]
Explain which fundamental need cluster this configuration prioritizes, which core capabilities compose the MVP, and what validation evidence supports these choices. Reference specific interview counts and need intensity levels.

[Paragraph 2: Differentiation & Validation - 3-4 sentences]
Explain which specific features provide competitive differentiation, what outcomes they enable that alternatives don't provide, and how they address current satisfaction gaps identified in needs analysis.

[Paragraph 3: Phasing Strategy - 2-3 sentences]
Explain which features are phased to mid/long-term and why (need intensity, validation levels, resource constraints, timeline dependencies). Clarify the logic for what's MVP vs. enhancement.
