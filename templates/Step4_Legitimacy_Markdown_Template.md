## IMPORTANT NOTES:

1. **All character limits are strict** - No exceptions. Use character counters.
2. **Evidence-based scoring** - Facts over aspirations. Low scores are valuable signals.
3. **Honest gap identification** - Critical for assessment value and decision-making.
4. **Differentiators must be genuine** - "Yes" only for truly rare/unique capabilities or assets.
5. **Overall Assessment must address**: Foundation solidity, dependencies, proceed/stop, focus areas.
6. **Create both outputs**: This markdown file + professionally formatted DOCX with identical content.
7. **File naming**: Use `Vianeo_Legitimacy_Worksheet_[ProjectName].[md/docx]` format.
