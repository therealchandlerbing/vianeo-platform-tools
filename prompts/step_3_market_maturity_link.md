## Step 3 Overview

### The 29 Questions Map To:

**LEGITIMACY** (15% weight, threshold 3.0)
- Q8: Problem definition and evidence
- Q13: Field of application clarity

**DESIRABILITY** (25% weight, threshold 3.5)
- Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4: User preferences and needs
- Q9, Q10: Engagement and retention
- Q14, Q15, Q16: Customer studies and behavior
- Q21, Q22: Market trends and substitutes
- Q27: Market expansion potential

**ACCEPTABILITY** (20% weight, threshold 3.0)
- Q5, Q6, Q7: Partners, dependencies, influencers
- Q17, Q18, Q19: Geographic, technology, network factors

**FEASIBILITY** (20% weight, threshold 3.0)
- Q11, Q12: Technical development and skills
- Q24, Q25, Q28: Speed, innovation, capital efficiency

**VIABILITY** (20% weight, threshold 3.0)
- Q20: Market size sufficiency
- Q23: Value capture efficiency
- Q26: Profitability timeline
- Q29: Follow-on funding access

### Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Absolutely - strong external validation |
| 4 | Almost - good evidence |
| 3 | Likely - basic validation |
| 2 | Maybe not - weak evidence |
| 1 | Don't know - no evidence |

### Overall Score Calculation

**Overall** = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

**Threshold:** ≥ 3.2 overall to pass

## Integration with Other Steps

**Input from Previous Steps:**
- Canvas from Step 0 provides foundation
- Diagnostic from Step 2 identifies capability gaps
- These inform evidence availability for Step 3

**Output to Next Steps:**
- Legitimacy score feeds into Step 4 (Legitimacy Deep Dive)
- Desirability score feeds into Step 5 (Desirability Analysis)
- Acceptability score feeds into Step 7 (Ecosystem Mapping)
- All scores inform final recommendation

## Next Steps After Completing Step 3

1. **Save assessment file** as `[CompanyName]_[Date]_03_MarketMaturity.md`
2. **Review dimensional scores** against thresholds
3. **Identify red flag patterns**
4. **Proceed to Step 4** for Legitimacy deep dive
