## Assessment Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Evidence Over Assumptions**
- Score based on documented evidence, not plans or intentions
- Require external validation (customer interviews, testing) for high scores
- Internal beliefs or assumptions receive low scores
- Missing evidence = Score 1

**2. Specificity Over Generality**
- Cite exact sources and documents
- Use specific numbers (interviews, tests, customers)
- Avoid vague language ("good progress", "working on it")
- Name specific people, companies, or documents

**3. Honesty Over Optimism**
- Lower scores are not failures - they show where to focus
- Don't inflate scores to make results look better
- Acknowledge gaps transparently
- Distinguished validated facts from aspirational goals

**4. Action Over Judgment**
- Every Score 1 must specify exactly what evidence is needed
- Identify concrete next steps
- Focus on how to improve, not just what's wrong

---

## Scoring Scale

Use this 1-5 scale for all questions:

### Score 5: Exceptional
- Extensive external validation
- Evidence from multiple independent sources
- Exceeds minimum thresholds significantly
- Documented, verified, and tested
- **Example**: 20+ customer interviews per segment with consistent validation

### Score 4: Strong
- Clear external validation
- Meets or slightly exceeds minimum thresholds
- Multiple sources of evidence
- Well-documented
- **Example**: 10-15 customer interviews per segment with clear patterns

### Score 3: Adequate
- Basic external validation
- Meets minimum thresholds
- Some evidence exists
- Initial documentation
- **Example**: 5-7 customer interviews per segment with emerging patterns

### Score 2: Weak
- Limited or only internal validation
- Below minimum thresholds
- Mostly assumptions or beliefs
- Little documentation
- **Example**: 1-3 customer interviews, no clear patterns

### Score 1: Insufficient
- No external validation
- No evidence
- Pure assumption or speculation
- Nothing documented
- **Must specify what evidence is needed**
- **Example**: No customer interviews conducted

## Critical Assessment Rules

### Must Follow These Rules

**1. Evidence Requirements**
- Score 4-5 MUST cite specific external evidence (document name, interview count, test results)
- Score 1 MUST specify exactly what evidence is needed
- Cannot use vague references ("team believes", "we think", "planning to")

**2. Justification Requirements**
- ONE sentence only
- Must be specific and factual
- Must connect directly to the score
- Must use numbers when available (X interviews, Y customers, Z tests)

**3. Consistency Requirements**
- If Q7 (interviews) = 1, then Q2, Q13, Q25 must be ≤ 2
- If Q6 (competitive analysis) = 1, then Q21 must be ≤ 2
- If Q22 (testing per segment) = 5, then Q9, Q12 must be ≥ 3
- If Q16 (team) = 1, then Q18, Q26 must be ≤ 2

**4. Red Flags - Stop and Highlight**
If any of these patterns appear, explicitly call them out:
- Q7 = 1 AND Q13 = 1 (no customer validation) → "CRITICAL: No customer validation"
- Q3 = 1 AND Q17 = 1 AND Q20 = 1 (ecosystem blindness) → "CRITICAL: Ecosystem not mapped"
- Q14 = 1 AND Q19 = 1 AND Q27 = 1 (business model untested) → "CRITICAL: Business model not validated"
- Q1 = 1 AND Q16 = 1 (resource gaps) → "CRITICAL: Insufficient resources"

**5. Evidence Citation Format**
- Good: "Pitch deck p.12, 15 customer interviews documented"
- Good: "Need: 10+ customer discovery interviews per segment"
- Bad: "Team has done research"
- Bad: "Customer validation in progress"

---

## Example Assessment Patterns

### Example 1: Early Stage (Score ~2.0)

**Pattern**: Many Score 1s, especially in Desirability and Viability

**Typical Scores**:
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews)
- Q13 = 1-2 (problem not validated)
- Q19 = 1 (revenue not tested)
- Q22 = 1 (no customer testing)

**Response**: "EARLY STAGE: Recommend customer discovery phase before further development"

### Example 2: Mid-Stage (Score ~3.0)

**Pattern**: Mix of 2s and 3s, some validation done

**Typical Scores**:
- Q7 = 2-3 (some interviews)
- Q13 = 3 (problem validated)
- Q19 = 2 (minimal revenue testing)
- Q22 = 2-3 (limited customer testing)

**Response**: "DEVELOPING: Strong foundation, need more validation to reach thresholds"

### Example 3: Advanced (Score ~4.0)

**Pattern**: Mostly 3s and 4s, strong validation

**Typical Scores**:
- Q7 = 4 (good interview coverage)
- Q13 = 4 (problem well-validated)
- Q19 = 3-4 (revenue model tested)
- Q22 = 4 (good customer testing)

**Response**: "PROMISING: Well-validated, address remaining gaps before scale"

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Pitfall 1: Scoring Plans Instead of Evidence**
- Wrong: Score 4 because "team plans to interview 20 customers"
- Right: Score 1 with "Need: 10+ customer interviews per segment"

**Pitfall 2: Vague Justifications**
- Wrong: "Good customer validation work"
- Right: "12 customer interviews per segment with consistent problem validation"

**Pitfall 3: Inflating Scores**
- Wrong: Score 3 for "talked to 2 customers"
- Right: Score 2 for "2 customer conversations, need 5+ per segment for Score 3"

**Pitfall 4: Missing Evidence Citations**
- Wrong: Score 5 with "strong validation"
- Right: Score 5 with "Business plan sections 3.2-3.4, 18 documented interviews"

**Pitfall 5: Inconsistent Scoring**
- Wrong: Q7 = 1 but Q13 = 4
- Right: If Q7 = 1 (no interviews) then Q13 cannot be > 2

---

## Reassessment Schedule

Based on Overall Score, recommend:

- **< 2.0**: Reassess every 2-4 weeks
- **2.0-2.9**: Reassess every 4 weeks
- **3.0-3.4**: Reassess every 4-6 weeks
- **3.5-4.4**: Reassess every 2-3 months
- **4.5+**: Reassess quarterly

Also recommend immediate reassessment after:
- Major business model changes
- Significant validation work completed
- Pivot decisions
- Funding rounds
- Market entry
