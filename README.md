## The Complete 12-Step Workflow

```
Step 0: Executive Brief Extraction (20-30 min)
  → B1-B7 structure with strict character limits (150-300 chars) + Maturity Stage (TRL 1-9)
  → Extracts core business model from raw application materials
  → Two outputs: Executive Brief template + Maturity classification

Step 1: Application Forms [OPTIONAL] (15-20 min)
  → 360 SIS (social impact) or CNEN (research) format with structured sections
  → Character limits enforced: 500 chars (summary), 750 chars (all other sections)

  → Two outputs: Assessment Results + Score Summary

Step 3: 29-Question Market Maturity (45-60 min)
  → Five dimensional scores: Legitimacy, Desirability, Acceptability, Feasibility, Viability
  → Weighted scoring with evidence requirements (5-20+ validations for scores ≥3)
  → Three outputs: Markdown report + Assessment Results DOCX + Dimension Analysis DOCX

Step 4: Legitimacy Deep Dive (20-30 min)
  → Problem definition, application domain, team & approach, available resources
  → Validates problem significance with external stakeholder confirmation
  → Two outputs: Markdown worksheet + DOCX formatted version

Step 5: Desirability - Needs/Requesters Analysis (30-40 min)
  → Requesters (6-10 roles), Needs (10: Tasks/Pains/Expectations, 60 chars each), Existing Solutions
  → Foundation for customer discovery and problem-solution fit validation
  → Four outputs: Markdown analysis + 3 DOCX (Core Analysis, Strategic Analysis, Interview Guide)

Step 6: Persona Development (60-90 min with interviews, 20-30 min from existing data)
  → 3-5 evidence-based personas with validation badges (Green/Orange/Red)
  → One output: Professional DOCX (3-11 pages) ready for committee evaluation
  → Four comprehensive guides: Skill overview, Generation prompt, Reference guide, System navigation

Step 7: Needs Qualification Matrix (45-90 min)
  → Visual dashboard with opportunity zones (Critical/High/Medium/Low) + strategic action plan
  → Importance vs. Satisfaction heatmap across customer segments with color-coded priorities
  → Two outputs: Interactive HTML needs matrix + Comprehensive analysis report (9-12 pages)

Step 8: Players & Influencers Ecosystem Analysis (30-45 min)
  → 8-10 Players (active participants) + 8-10 Influencers (market shapers)
  → Acceptability ratings (Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable) with strategic notes
  → Two outputs: Professional 2-page DOCX (BCG-level) + Markdown analysis
  → Optional: Python generator for automated formatting

Step 9: Ecosystem Value Network Map (60-90 min)
  → Identifies Priority Targets (Favorable organizations + Critical/Important needs)
  → Color-coded visual network with 5 value chain positions
  → Four outputs: Master Markdown + Ecosystem Data DOCX + Priority Targets DOCX + HTML Visualization

Step 10: Vianeo Diagnostic Comment & Report (25-35 min)
  → Executive diagnostic: Strengths, Risks, Actions with owners, Evidence gaps (6-8 sentences)
  → Dimension summary table with color-coded scores + Critical path forward (4 time horizons)
  → Two outputs: Markdown diagnostic + Professional DOCX with design elevation
  → Seven comprehensive guides: Skill, Prompt, Reference, Template, DOCX formatting, Examples, Quality checklist

Step 11: Features & Needs Matrix (30-45 min)
  → Dual-view interactive toggle: Partners (external dependencies) ↔ Means (internal resources)
  → Implementation timeline badges + color-coded opportunity levels (High/Medium/Low/Expected/Accessory)
  → Two outputs: Interactive HTML (CSV export, print-optimized, WCAG 2.1 AA) + Strategic analysis markdown
  → Complete skill package (7 files): Primary skill, Quick Reference, Data Worksheet, Implementation Guide, Template, CSS

Step 12: Viability Assessment - Product-Market Fit & Business Model (2-4 hours per product)
  → Product/Market Fit Sheets: Product identity, targeted requesters, MVP features (6-10), resource requirements
  → Business Model Canvas: Value proposition, revenue model, distribution channel, cost structure (≤250 chars each)
  → Coherence validation with evidence-based approach (no aspirational planning, flags assumptions explicitly)
  → Three outputs per product: PMF Sheet (md + docx), Business Model (md + docx), Summary Dashboard (md)
```

**Evidence Required:**
- Business model canvas complete
- Pricing tested with 5+ customers
- Financial projections with validated assumptions
- Unit economics (LTV:CAC ratio)

---

## Scoring Scales

### Evidence-Based Scale (All Steps)

| Score | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------|------------------|
| **5** | **Exceptional** | 15-20+ external validations, multiple sources, documented |
| **4** | **Strong** | 10-15 external validations, clear evidence |
| **3** | **Adequate** | 5-10 external validations (minimum threshold) |
| **2** | **Weak** | 1-4 validations, mostly assumptions |
| **1** | **Insufficient** | No external validation, pure assumption |

### Overall Score Categories

| Score Range | Category | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 4.5-5.0 | **Strong** | Proceed with implementation |
| 3.5-4.4 | **Promising** | Proceed, strengthen gaps |
| 3.0-3.4 | **Developing** | Conditional proceed, address gaps |
| 2.0-2.9 | **Problematic** | Reassess assumptions, pivot likely |
| <2.0 | **Non-viable** | Consider pivot or validation sprint |

- Importance vs. Satisfaction across segments

**Ecosystem Value Network Map** (Step 9):
- FOUR deliverables: Master Markdown (comprehensive) + Ecosystem Data DOCX (formatted) + Priority Targets DOCX (formatted) + HTML Visualization (presentation)
- Identifies Priority Targets: Favorable organizations + Critical/Important needs
- 5-column layout (Enablers → Product → Channels → Buyers → End Users)
- Color-coded priority targets (green gradient = highest conversion probability)
- Need badges (Critical/Important/Secondary) and acceptability dots (green/orange/red)
- DOCX files include detailed styling specifications (fonts, colors, spacing) for Word
- Strategic engagement plan with specific actions, timelines, and resource requirements

**Vianeo Diagnostic Comment** (Step 10):
- Professional DOCX with design elevation
- Color-coded dimension summary table (green/yellow/red scores)
- Typography scale (24pt/16pt/14pt/11pt) with strategic color palette
- Formatted critical path with numbered priorities and bullet metrics

**Features-Needs Matrix** (Step 11):
- Dual-view interactive HTML: Toggle between Partners (external) and Means (internal resources)
- Implementation timeline badges + color-coded opportunity levels
- CSV export, print-optimized, WCAG 2.1 AA compliant
- Strategic analysis with MVP scoping for Step 12

### Quality Control

Built-in quality gates between steps:
- Character limit verification
- Evidence citation checks
- Consistency validation
- Red flag identification

---

## Critical Red Flags

### 🚨 Pattern 1: No Customer Validation
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews)
- Q13 = 1 (problem not validated)
- Q22 = 1 (not tested with customers)

**Action:** STOP building. START customer discovery immediately.

### 🚨 Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness
- Q3 = 1 (no ecosystem map)
- Q17 = 1 (no resistance identified)
- Multiple unfavorable critical players

**Action:** Map ecosystem before investing more. May face unexpected resistance.

### 🚨 Pattern 3: Business Model Untested
- Q14 = 1 (revenue undefined)
- Q19 = 1 (not tested with customers)
- Q27 = 1 (can't articulate value)

**Action:** Define and test revenue model immediately. Great product ≠ sustainable business.

### 🚨 Pattern 4: Resource Constraints
- Q1 = 1 (lacking resources)
- Q16 = 1 (no committed team)
- Team all part-time

**Action:** Secure resources before proceeding. Execution impossible without fundamentals.
