### Strategic Focus Organizations

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Priority targets are organizations that meet BOTH criteria:
- ✅ **Favorable** toward our innovation (organizational acceptability demonstrated)
- ✅ **Contain requesters with Critical or Important needs** (urgent individual pain points)

These represent our **highest-probability conversion opportunities** where organizational support aligns with urgent individual needs—the sweet spot for sales and partnership success.

### Priority Targets Overview

**Total Priority Targets Identified:** [Number]

**By Need Level:**
- **Critical Needs:** [Number] organizations
- **Important Needs:** [Number] organizations

**By Value Chain Position:**
- **Enablers & Influencers:** [Number]
- **Channels & Partners:** [Number]
- **Buyers & Clients:** [Number]
- **End Users (Downstream):** [Number]

**Strategic Implication:**
[1-2 sentences on what this distribution means for your go-to-market strategy. Example: "Heavy concentration of priority targets among Buyers (7) and End Users (6) suggests direct sales approach will be most effective. Limited priority targets among Channels (2) indicates partnership strategy needs strengthening."]
