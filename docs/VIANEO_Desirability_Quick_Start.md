## APPENDIX: CUSTOMER DISCOVERY INTERVIEW GUIDE

### Interview Structure (45-60 minutes)

**Opening (5 min)**
- Explain research purpose (understanding [topic], not selling)
- Promise confidentiality
- Ask permission to record

**Current State (15 min)**
*Explore their current situation and practices:*

- Tell me about your use of [relevant context]
- Walk me through your current [process/approach]
- Who are your current [suppliers/partners]? How did you select them?
- What's working well with your current approach?
- What challenges or frustrations do you face?

**Problem Validation (15 min)**
*Validate the problems and pain points:*

- How concerned are you about [specific problem from legitimacy]?
- Have you experienced [specific pain point]? Tell me about that.
- What would have to be true for you to [desired behavior change]?
- How important is [specific capability] vs. [alternative approach]?
- [Context-specific probing question]?

**Pricing & Willingness to Pay (10 min)**
*Understand financial constraints and decision factors:*

- What do you currently pay for [comparable solution]? (or estimate if unknown)
- What price premium (if any) would you accept for [key differentiation]?
- What other factors besides price drive your purchasing decisions?
- Walk me through your decision-making process for switching [suppliers/solutions]

**Solution Validation (10 min)**
*Introduce technology AFTER understanding their needs:*

- Briefly describe [your solution capability/approach]
- Which of these capabilities, if any, would be valuable to you? Why?
- What concerns or questions do you have about [new supplier/approach]?
- What would you need to see/test before considering this as alternative?

**Close (5 min)**
*Next steps and relationship building:*

- Who else should I talk to about this?
- Would you be open to testing [sample/prototype] in the future?
- Can I follow up with you as the project progresses?

### Key Insights to Capture

*Document these critical elements during and after each interview:*

- **Actual pain intensity** (not assumed)
- **Willingness to pay** and price constraints
- **Technical specifications** that matter
- **Decision criteria and process**
- **Objections and concerns** (technical, commercial, risk)
- **Alternative solutions** they've considered
- **Referrals** to other potential customers

### Interview Best Practices

**1. Listen More, Talk Less**
Let the interviewee speak 80% of the time. Your role is to understand their world, not pitch your solution.

**2. Ask Open-Ended Questions**
Use "Tell me about..." and "Walk me through..." instead of yes/no questions. Get stories, not sound bites.

**3. Dig Deeper with Follow-Ups**
When something interesting comes up, probe: "Why is that?" "Tell me more about that." "What happened next?"

**4. Listen for Problems, Not Solutions**
Don't ask "Would you use our [solution]?" Ask "What challenges do you face with your current [approach]?"

**5. Validate with Specifics**
Get concrete data: actual prices paid, specific supplier names, real disruption incidents, documented specs.

**6. Don't Sell, Learn**
Frame as research, not sales. You're trying to understand their needs, not convince them to buy.

**7. End with Referrals**
Always ask who else you should talk to. The best interviews come from warm introductions.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Leading questions:** Don't ask "Wouldn't it be great if...?" or "Don't you hate it when...?"
- **Pitching too early:** Wait until you understand their needs before describing your solution
- **Taking "nice" responses at face value:** "That sounds interesting" is not validation
- **Ignoring negative signals:** If they're satisfied with current solutions, that's valuable data
- **Not documenting immediately:** Write notes right after the interview while memory is fresh
- **Confirmation bias:** Listen for what they actually say, not what you want to hear

### Target Interview Segments

*Conduct [total number] interviews distributed across these segments:*

- **[Number] [Requester Segment 1]** [access strategy/rationale]
- **[Number] [Requester Segment 2]** [access strategy/rationale]
- **[Number] [Requester Segment 3]** [access strategy/rationale]

***Success target: [Number]+ completed interviews ([XX]% completion rate)***
