# Shared Prompt Guidelines

Use these shared blocks to keep instructions consistent across prompts while reducing duplication:

## Time, Output, and Optional Status
- **Time Required:** Specify realistic ranges to set expectations.
- **Output:** Name the deliverable up front (e.g., "Executive Brief" or "Standardized application form").
- **Status:** Note whether a step is **OPTIONAL** and when to skip it.

## Skip Criteria (Reusable Checklist)
Use the "Skip this step if" checklist wherever the step is optional:
- The team is working ad-hoc without formal program structure.
- No standardized format or downstream process requires this deliverable.
- The next step (e.g., diagnostic or market maturity) will start immediately.

## Quality Checks (Reusable)
- Confirm all required fields are completed and consistent with the Canvas.
- Respect character/word limits for each field.
- Validate dates, URLs, and contact information.
- Ensure there are no contradictions between steps.

## Output Naming Pattern
Use a consistent, sortable naming convention:
`[CompanyOrProjectName]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_[step#]_[DeliverableName].md`

**Example:** `HealthTech_2025-01-15_01_Application.md`

Keeping these shared blocks centralized makes future prompt edits smaller and ensures every step uses the same expectations.
