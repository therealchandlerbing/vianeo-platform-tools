## The 8-Step Workflow

```
Step 0: Canvas Extraction (20-30 min) → Structured business model
Step 1: Application Forms [OPTIONAL] (15 min) → Program tracking
Step 2: 40-Question Diagnostic (30-45 min) → Team/Tech/Mgmt/Commercial
Step 3: 29-Question Market Maturity (45-60 min) → 5 Dimensional scores
Step 4: Legitimacy Deep Dive (20-30 min) → Problem validation
Step 5: Desirability Analysis (30-40 min) → Segments, needs, personas
Step 6: Needs Matrix (45 min) → HTML priority heatmap
Step 7: Ecosystem Mapping (30-45 min) → Stakeholder acceptability
Step 8: Network Visualization (60-90 min) → Interactive HTML map
```

**Total Time:**
- **Fast Track** (0,2,4,5): 90 min
- **Standard** (0-7): 3-4 hours
- **Complete** (0-8): 5-6 hours

## Critical Character Limits

| Field | Max Characters |
|-------|----------------|
| Problem Statement | 250 |
| Field of Application | 60 |
| Needs Statements | 60 each |
| Player/Segment Names | 60 each |
| Ecosystem Notes | 250 |
| Resources | 250 |
| Revenue Model | 250 |
| Differentiators | 250 |

---

## Scoring Scales

### Step 2 (40-Question Diagnostic): 1-5 Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Complete - external validation, documented |
| 4 | Strong - some external validation |
| 3 | Adequate - internal validation only |
| 2 | Weak - significant gaps, aware but not addressed |
| 1 | Critical gap - no evidence, major deficiency |

### Step 3 (Market Maturity): 1-5 Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Absolutely - strong external validation |
| 4 | Almost - good evidence |
| 3 | Likely - basic validation |
| 2 | Maybe not - weak evidence |
| 1 | Don't know - no evidence |

## The Five Dimensions (Step 3)

| Dimension | Weight | Threshold | Questions | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Legitimacy** | 15% | 3.0 | 2 | Problem real? |
| **Desirability** | 25% | 3.5 | 12 | Customers want it? |
| **Acceptability** | 20% | 3.0 | 6 | Ecosystem supports? |
| **Feasibility** | 20% | 3.0 | 5 | Team can deliver? |
| **Viability** | 20% | 3.0 | 4 | Business sustainable? |

**Overall Threshold:** ≥ 3.2

**Formula:** (L×0.15) + (D×0.25) + (A×0.20) + (F×0.20) + (V×0.20)

---

## Critical Evidence Thresholds

### For Score 3 (Minimum):

- **Customer Interviews:** 5-10 per segment
- **User Testing:** 5-10 users for prototype
- **Competitive Analysis:** 2-3 alternatives researched
- **Stakeholders Identified:** 3-5 key players
- **Resources Secured:** 60%+ of needs

### For Score 4:

- **Customer Interviews:** 10-15 per segment
- **User Testing:** 10-15 users
- **Competitive Analysis:** 3-5 alternatives analyzed
- **Stakeholders:** 5-10 identified
- **Resources:** 80%+ secured

### For Score 5:

- **Customer Interviews:** 15-20+ per segment
- **User Testing:** 20+ users
- **Competitive Analysis:** 5+ alternatives, direct testing
- **Stakeholders:** 10+ validated
- **Resources:** 100% secured

---

## Red Flags to Watch

### Pattern 1: No Customer Validation
- Zero customer interviews (Step 3: Q7 = 1)
- Problem not validated (Step 3: Q13 = 1)
- Solution not tested (Step 3: Q22 = 1)
→ **STOP building, START interviewing**

### Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness
- No ecosystem map (Step 3: Q3 = 1)
- No resistance identified (Step 7: unfavorable critical players)
- Market structure unknown (Step 3: Q20 = 1)
→ **Map ecosystem before proceeding**

### Pattern 3: Business Model Untested
- Revenue undefined (Step 3: Q14 = 1)
- Pricing not tested (Step 3: Q19 = 1)
- No value capture (Step 3: Q27 = 1)
→ **Test revenue model immediately**

### Pattern 4: Resource Constraints
- Resources lacking (Step 2: T9 ≤ 2, Step 3: Q1 = 1)
- No committed team (Step 2: T9 = 1)
- Can't develop (Step 3: Q26 = 1)
→ **Secure resources before proceeding**

## Needs Matrix Priority Zones (Step 6)

| Zone | Color | Criteria |
|------|-------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Red | Fundamental need (4) + Not satisfied (1) |
| 🟠 **High** | Orange | Important (3-4) + Rather not satisfied (1-2) |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Yellow | Secondary (2) + Not satisfied (1-2) |
| 🟢 **Low** | Green | Any need + Well satisfied (3-4) |

---

## Acceptability Ratings (Step 7)

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Favorable** | Supportive, ready to engage | Leverage relationship |
| **Neutral** | Aware but uncommitted | Engage and influence |
| **Unfavorable** | Resistant or opposed | Mitigate or work around |

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk:** Unfavorable + Critical player
- **Medium Risk:** Unfavorable + Important player
- **Low Risk:** Unfavorable + Helpful player
