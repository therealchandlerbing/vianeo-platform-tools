- No marketing fluff or buzzwords
- Specific and measurable when possible
- Must convey value proposition clearly

**Good Examples:**
- "AI-powered diagnostic tool helping rural clinics reduce misdiagnosis rates by 40% through automated triage" (110 chars)
- "Mobile platform connecting smallholder farmers to buyers, eliminating 3 intermediaries and doubling income" (108 chars)

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ "Revolutionary platform transforming healthcare through innovation" (too vague, no specifics)
- ❌ "Using AI and ML to disrupt the market with our unique approach" (buzzwords, no substance)

---

### B2: Problem Statement (MAX 300 CHARACTERS)

**Focus:** What measurable problem exists? Who is affected? What is the current impact?

**Requirements:**

- **Specific population** identified with size estimates when possible
- **Quantifiable impact** - numbers, percentages, costs, time lost
- **Validated externally** or clearly marked as "Assumed" if not validated

**Structure:**
[Who] faces [specific problem] resulting in [measurable impact]. Currently, [describe gap/inadequacy].

**Good Example:**
"Rural primary care clinics serving 2.3M patients lack timely access to specialist expertise, resulting in 35% misdiagnosis rates for complex conditions. Current telemedicine options require 2+ weeks for consultation, causing treatment delays." (268 chars)

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ "Patients need better healthcare technology" (not specific, solution-embedded)
- ❌ "The market lacks innovation in diagnostics" (vague, no impact quantified)

**Evidence Tracking:**

**Structure:**
Revenue model: [how money is made]. Pricing: [strategy/tiers]. Unit economics: LTV $[X], CAC $[Y], LTV:CAC ratio [Z:1], gross margin [%]. Current status: [MRR/ARR or "Pre-revenue"].

**Good Example:**
"SaaS subscription: $299/month per clinic (tier 1: 5 providers), $599/month (tier 2: 10+ providers). Annual contracts with 15% discount. Est. LTV: $18K, CAC: $3.5K (5:1 ratio), 75% gross margin. Current: $12K MRR, 8 paying customers." (248 chars)

## COMMON ISSUES AND FIXES

### Issue 1: Character Limit Violations

**Problem:** Section exceeds character limit

**Fixes:**
1. Remove adjectives and adverbs ("very", "extremely", "innovative")
2. Use active voice instead of passive
3. Replace phrases with single words where possible
4. Abbreviate where unambiguous (US vs United States, MRR vs Monthly Recurring Revenue)
5. Combine related sentences

**Example:**
- Before (325 chars): "The healthcare providers who are working in rural areas are facing significant challenges in accessing timely specialist expertise, which results in approximately 35% of complex medical conditions being misdiagnosed, causing substantial delays in treatment."
- After (268 chars): "Rural primary care clinics serving 2.3M patients lack timely access to specialist expertise, resulting in 35% misdiagnosis rates for complex conditions. Current telemedicine options require 2+ weeks for consultation, causing treatment delays."

### Issue 2: Solution-Embedded Problem Statement

**Problem:** B2 mentions the solution, technology, or product

**Fixes:**
1. Remove all technology references (AI, platform, app, etc.)
2. Focus on the GAP or NEED, not the solution
3. Add measurable impact
4. Describe current inadequate alternatives

**Example:**
- ❌ Before: "Rural clinics need an AI-powered diagnostic platform to improve accuracy"
- ✅ After: "Rural clinics serving 2.3M patients have 35% misdiagnosis rates for complex conditions due to lack of specialist access"

### Issue 3: Vague Traction Claims

**Problem:** B6 uses qualitative statements without numbers

**Fixes:**
1. Replace "good traction" with specific numbers
2. Replace "in discussions" with "# LOIs signed" or "# meetings held"
3. Replace "strong interest" with "# interviews showing intent to purchase"
4. If no numbers available, state: "No quantitative traction data available"

**Example:**
- ❌ Before: "Strong market validation with good user feedback and partner interest"
- ✅ After: "Customer validation: 45 interviews, 8 pilot clinics (6 months), 3 paying customers. Partnerships: MOU with State Rural Health Assoc."

### Issue 4: Missing Evidence Tracking

**Problem:** Claims made without noting evidence source

**Fixes:**
1. For every claim in B2-B7, add evidence tracking
2. If no evidence, explicitly state "ASSUMED" or "No data"
3. Provide numbers: # interviews, # studies cited, # pilots
4. Note source type: Stakeholder interviews / Published research / Internal analysis

**Example:**
- ❌ Before: Just stating "Rural clinics have 35% misdiagnosis rates"
- ✅ After: Adding "Validated with: 12 clinic interviews + published AMA study (2023)"

### Issue 5: Users and Buyers Not Distinguished

**Problem:** B4 doesn't clarify who uses vs. who pays

**Fixes:**
1. Explicitly state if users = buyers: "Users and buyers are the same"
2. If different, show both: "Users: [X]. Buyers: [Y]."
3. Explain relationship if multi-sided market
4. Identify decision-making unit for B2B

**Example:**
- ❌ Before: "Target market: Healthcare industry"
- ✅ After: "Users: Rural clinic physicians (45K in US). Buyers: Rural health systems (1,200 networks)"

## INTEGRATION WITH VIANEO SYSTEM

### How Step 0 Feeds Other Steps

**→ Step 1 (Application Forms):**
- B1-B7 content maps to application fields
- Supplementary notes provide additional context
- Evidence tracking shows validation depth

**→ Step 2 (40-Question Diagnostic):**
- B7 informs Team dimension questions
- B3/B5 inform Technology dimension
- B5/B6 inform Commercial dimension
- Maturity stage sets baseline expectations

**→ Step 3 (Market Maturity 29Q):**
- B2 informs Legitimacy dimension (problem validation)
- B4 informs Desirability dimension (customer segments)
- B5 informs Viability dimension (business model)
- B6 evidence tracking shows validation depth across all dimensions

**→ Steps 4-8 (Deep Dives):**
- Problem statement (B2) feeds Legitimacy deep dive
- Users/market (B4) feeds Desirability analysis
- Supplementary notes on ecosystem feed Acceptability mapping
- All evidence tracking identifies gaps for validation

### Quality Gate Before Proceeding

- [ ] All character limits met
- [ ] Problem statement is solution-neutral
- [ ] Evidence is tracked for all major claims
- [ ] Red flags are explicitly noted

## NOTES FOR AI ASSISTANTS

When executing this prompt:

1. **Prioritize evidence-based statements** - If information isn't in the application, mark as "ASSUMED" or "No data"
2. **Enforce character limits strictly** - These are not suggestions; they ensure clarity and force prioritization
3. **Be solution-neutral in B2** - This is critical for objective problem validation
4. **Quantify everything in B6** - No vague traction claims
5. **Identify gaps honestly** - Missing evidence is valuable information for evaluators
6. **Flag red flags explicitly** - Zero customer validation, no prototype, part-time team, etc.
7. **Generate both MD and DOCX** - MD for editing, DOCX for professional presentation

**Common AI Assistant Mistakes to Avoid:**
- ❌ Exceeding character limits "just a bit" - NO, enforce strictly
- ❌ Assuming validation exists when application doesn't specify - Mark as "ASSUMED"
- ❌ Using marketing language from pitch deck - Translate to factual, evidence-based language
- ❌ Embedding solutions in problem statement - Keep B2 solution-neutral
- ❌ Vague traction statements - Always quantify with numbers
