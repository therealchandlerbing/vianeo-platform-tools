## MVP Features

### Feature Selection Criteria Applied

Features selected based on:

2. ✅ Has >5 interviews validation (high confidence)
3. ✅ Timeline: "Short term" or "Already available"
4. ✅ Serves MULTIPLE clients (efficiency)

### MVP Features Table

| # | Feature Name | Needs Covered | Clients Served | Timeline | Validation | MVP Rationale |
|---|-------------|---------------|----------------|----------|------------|---------------|
| 1 | [Feature 1] | [Need A, Need B] | [Client 1, 2] | Available | >5 interviewed | [Why MVP: fundamental need, cross-client] |
| 2 | [Feature 2] | [Need C] | [Client 1, 3] | Short term | >5 interviewed | [Why MVP] |
| 3 | [Feature 3] | [Need D, E] | [Client 2] | Short term | <5 interviewed | [Why MVP despite lower validation] |
| 4 | [Feature 4] | [Need F] | [Client 1, 2, 3] | Available | >5 interviewed | [Why MVP] |
| 5 | [Feature 5] | [Need G] | [Client 1] | Short term | >5 interviewed | [Why MVP] |
| 6 | [Feature 6] | [Need H, I] | [Client 2, 3] | Short term | >5 interviewed | [Why MVP] |

[Continue for 6-10 MVP features]

### MVP Summary

**Timeline Distribution**:
- Available now: [Count]
- Short-term (0-6 mo): [Count]
- Mid-term (6-18 mo): [Count if any]

**Validation Strength**:
- High validation (>5 interviews): [Count]/[Total] = [%]

**Client Coverage Efficiency**:

### Additional Features (Phased - Post-MVP)

| Feature Name | Needs Covered | Clients | Timeline | Validation | Phasing Rationale |
|--------------|---------------|---------|----------|------------|-------------------|
| [Feature X] | [Need J] | [Client 2] | Mid term | >5 interviewed | [Why phased: important not fundamental] |
| [Feature Y] | [Need K] | [Client 1] | Long term | Not interviewed | [Why phased: low validation] |

---

## Coverage Validation

### Coverage by Client

#### Client 1: [Name]

| Fundamental Need | Covered by Feature | Status |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| [Need 1] | [Feature X] | ✓ Covered |
| [Need 2] | [Feature Y] | ✓ Covered |
| [Need 3] | — | ⚠️ Gap |

**Coverage**: [X]/[Y] fundamental needs covered

#### Client 2: [Name]

| Fundamental Need | Covered by Feature | Status |
|-----------------|-------------------|--------|
| [Need 1] | [Feature X] | ✓ Covered |
| [Need 2] | [Feature Z] | ✓ Covered |

- [ ] MVP size is 6-10 features ✓
- [ ] >50% of MVP features have >5 interviews validation ✓
- [ ] Each client has fundamental needs covered ✓

**Gaps Identified**:
[List any fundamental needs without feature coverage per client, or note "None - all fundamental needs covered for all clients"]

## Configuration Rationale

### Feature Selection Logic

**Core Value Focus**:
[3-4 sentences: Explain which fundamental need cluster this configuration prioritizes across clients. Describe which core capabilities compose the MVP and what validation evidence supports these choices. Reference specific interview counts and need intensity levels.]

**Multi-Client Efficiency**:
[3-4 sentences: Explain how the feature set serves multiple clients efficiently. Identify which features provide cross-client value versus client-specific value. Justify any client-specific features included in MVP.]

**Phasing Strategy**:
[2-3 sentences: Explain which features are phased to mid/long-term and why (need intensity, validation levels, resource constraints). Clarify the logic for what's MVP vs. enhancement.]
