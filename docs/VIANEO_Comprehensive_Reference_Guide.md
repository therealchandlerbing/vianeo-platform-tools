### Assessment Questions

**Q1.** You have solid and tangible resources (team, network, skills, patents, finances, equipment...) to launch and carry out this project.

**Q2.** You have identified people with strong needs AND who are looking for solutions to better meet their needs.

**Q3.** You know the market players in your ecosystem: you are able to name a number of them (not just your clients and competitors).

**Q4.** You have defined your offer and its features according to the needs that are not met today.

**Q5.** You target the customers who are the easiest to reach and the most strategic to help you enter the market.

**Q6.** You have identified and studied the solutions currently used to meet the expressed needs, competitor or alternative.

**Q7.** You have checked through direct interviews, with at least 5 people with the same profile, that they express needs.

**Q8.** You have identified one (or more) market(s) or field(s) of application for your project.

**Q9.** You have defined your product/market fit: you provide each customer segment you target an offer that meets their needs.

**Q10.** Regulations (current or future) may help your project to grow (legislation, standards...).

**Q11.** Customers will easily perceive the interest of your offer because it brings them real added value compared to existing solutions (new offer, new market, competitive advantage).

**Q12.** You regularly test your offer with users, whatever its stage of development.

**Q13.** Your solution aims to solve a real problem. You have validated with a number of people that this problem is a real thorn in their side (and not only for yourself).

---

### Content Generation Best Practices

#### Writing for Character Limits

**Problem Statement (250 chars)**
- Focus on the core issue without embedding solutions
- Use "How might we..." format when appropriate
- Include context on urgency or significance
- Example length: 2-3 sentences maximum

**Field of Application (60 chars)**
- Be specific but not overly narrow
- Examples: "Senior care in urban areas" or "Clinical cognitive assessment"
- Avoid: Generic terms like "healthcare" alone

**Needs Statements (60 chars each)**
- One need per statement
- Use clear, action-oriented language
- Examples:
  - "Track cognitive decline objectively over time"
  - "Access clinical-grade tools without facility visits"

**Ecosystem Player Names (60 chars)**
- Include role if helpful: "Dr. Maria Santos, Geriatric Specialist"
- Or organization: "Regional Home Health Agencies"

**Differentiating Advantages (250 chars)**
- Lead with the strongest differentiator
- Quantify when possible
- Address "why now" or "why you"
- Example length: 2-3 concise sentences

---

### Quick Validation Checklist

Before submitting content:

- [ ] Character count verified for each field
- [ ] No field exceeds its limit
- [ ] Content is complete despite brevity
- [ ] No critical context sacrificed for length
- [ ] Clear, specific language used (no fluff)

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. Embedding solutions in problem statements (wastes precious characters)
2. Using vague language ("various stakeholders" vs. naming specific ones)
3. Redundant phrasing ("in order to" vs. "to")
4. Over-explaining in short fields (60-char fields need punch, not prose)
5. Forgetting to count spaces (they count toward limits)

---

### Field-by-Field Character Strategy

#### 60-Character Fields
- Think Twitter-style: every word counts
- Lead with the most important information
- Use abbreviations only if universally understood
- Prioritize nouns and verbs over adjectives

#### 250-Character Fields
- 2-3 sentences maximum
- Use parallel structure for lists within prose
- Frontload the key point
- Remove filler words ruthlessly

---

### Emergency Editing Tips

If over limit:

1. Remove adjectives first
2. Convert phrases to single words ("a lot of" → "many")
3. Use active voice (shorter than passive)
4. Cut redundant information
5. Combine related ideas into compound sentences

---

## Sprint Execution Guide: Common Pitfalls and Solutions

### Problem Statements

#### Pitfall: Embedding the solution in the problem description

The problem statement should describe the challenge, not prescribe a specific solution.

**How to avoid:**
- Use the "How might we..." format to frame the problem
- Focus on the user need or pain point, not your product
- Test it: Can someone read your problem statement and imagine multiple different solutions?

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor:** "How might we create a mobile app to help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness?"
*(Embeds "mobile app" as the solution)*

✅ **Better:** "How might we help seniors maintain cognitive sharpness during aging?"
*(Opens space for multiple solution approaches)*

**Character limit:** 250 characters

---

### Scoring and Evidence

#### Pitfall 1: Scoring without sufficient evidence

Assigning scores based on assumptions or optimism rather than validated data.

**How to avoid:**
- Default to a score of 1 with notation "Insufficient data" when evidence is lacking
- Require specific evidence citations for any score of 4 or 5
- Use the reliability ratings system for transparency

**Scoring Scale (1-5):**
- **5:** Exceptional with best-in-class evidence
- **4:** Strong with above-average validation and minor gaps
- **3:** Adequate with basic requirements met
- **2:** Weak with significant gaps requiring attention
- **1:** Critical gap, major deficiency, or no evidence

**Evidence Reliability Ratings:**
- **More than 5 interviewed:** Strong evidence base
- **Less than 5 interviewed:** Preliminary validation
- **Not yet interviewed:** Hypothesis only
- **Unspecified:** No data available

---

#### Pitfall 2: Optimistic scoring bias

Tendency to score aspirations rather than current reality.

**How to avoid:**
- Ask: "What evidence supports this score?"
- Distinguish between what exists today vs. what could exist
- Have a second evaluator review scores independently
- Remember: Lower scores identify where work is needed, which is valuable

---

### User and Client Personas

#### Pitfall: Generic or vague personas

Creating personas that could describe almost anyone ("busy professionals aged 25-45").

**How to avoid:**
- Include specific behaviors, not just demographics
- Use actual quotes from interviews
- Describe their current workarounds or solutions
- Name their specific pain points with real examples

**Good Persona Structure:**
- **Who they are:** Specific role and context
- **What they do:** Actual behaviors and patterns
- **What they need:** Specific unmet needs
- **How they currently solve it:** Existing solutions and workarounds
- **Direct quote:** Something they actually said in research

---

#### Pitfall: Confusing users with buyers/clients

Treating the person who uses the solution and the person who pays for it as the same entity.

**How to avoid:**
- Create separate personas for users and clients if they differ
- Map the decision-making process: Who influences? Who approves? Who pays?
- Clarify in the Business Model Canvas: "Your users" vs. "Your clients"
- Consider that needs may differ between these groups

**Example:**
- **User:** Senior living resident (uses cognitive training)
- **Client:** Senior living facility administrator (pays for solution)

---

### Needs Statements

#### Pitfall: Overlapping or redundant needs

Writing multiple needs statements that essentially say the same thing.

**How to avoid:**
- Ensure each need is distinct and measurable
- Test: Could you satisfy one need without satisfying the other?
- Avoid breaking down a single need into false subcategories
- Prioritize: Which needs are most critical?

**Character limit per need:** 60 characters

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor (overlapping):**
- "Maintain brain health"
- "Keep mind sharp"
- "Prevent cognitive decline"

✅ **Better (distinct):**
- "Track cognitive performance objectively"
- "Practice evidence-based brain training"
- "Identify early decline signs"

---

### Quality Check Before Submission

Run through this checklist:

- [ ] Problem statement is solution-neutral
- [ ] All scores have supporting evidence noted
- [ ] Personas include specific behaviors and quotes
- [ ] Each need is distinct and measurable
- [ ] All required fields are within character limits
- [ ] Users and clients are properly distinguished
- [ ] Evidence reliability is noted for key claims
- [ ] No overlapping or redundant needs
- [ ] Ecosystem players and influencers are clearly mapped

---

### When You're Stuck

**If you're not sure about a score:**
Default to 1 or 2 with "Insufficient data" and note what evidence you need.

**If personas feel generic:**
Go back to your interviews. What specific thing did someone say or do that surprised you?

**If needs overlap:**
Ask, "Could I satisfy one without satisfying the other?" If no, combine them.

**If you're over character limit:**
Cut adjectives first, then look for redundant phrases.

---

## Supporting Tool: Needs Qualification Matrix

### Purpose
Systematically evaluate the importance and current satisfaction level of each identified need across different requester segments.

### Matrix Structure

For each need/requester combination, determine:

- **Importance:** Fundamental | Important | Secondary | None | Don't know
- **Satisfaction:** Very well | Pretty much | Rather not | Not at all | Don't know

### Output Format

Return a clean table with each cell showing:
**I:** [level]
**S:** [level]

### Input Requirements

**Needs:**
- [Need statement]
- [Need statement]
- [Need statement]
- [etc.]

**Requester Segments:**
- [Segment name]
- [Segment name]
- [Segment name]
- [etc.]

### Usage Notes

This matrix helps identify:

- High-importance, low-satisfaction needs (priority opportunities)
- Needs that vary significantly across segments
- Segments with the most critical unmet needs
- Areas where current solutions are adequate
