# Vianeo Main Diagnostic Comment Skill

## Overview

This skill package provides comprehensive instructions and templates for generating executive-ready Vianeo diagnostic comments with both markdown and professionally formatted DOCX outputs.

## What This Skill Does

Transforms Vianeo Business Model Evaluation findings into concise, actionable executive diagnostics that synthesize:
- Validated strengths and competitive advantages
- Critical risks and vulnerabilities
- Near-term actions with responsible owners
- Evidence gaps limiting decision confidence
- Dimension scores and interpretations
- Phased critical path forward

## Outputs Generated

**Every diagnostic produces exactly 2 files:**

1. **Markdown** (`.md`) - Clean, portable format for version control and internal review
2. **Professional DOCX** (`.docx`) - Executive-ready format with design elevation for stakeholders

Both contain identical content with professional formatting applied to the DOCX.

## Key Principles

**Conciseness**
- 6-8 sentences total in Executive Diagnostic
- Every sentence must add unique value
- No redundancy or generic statements

**Specificity**
- Use numbers, names, concrete examples
- "50+ beta users, zero revenue" not "early traction"
- "Shawna" and "Soufiane" not "the team"

**Actionability**
- Each action has owner in parentheses
- Time-bound recommendations (30-60 days)
- Clear, measurable success metrics

**Evidence-Based**
- Every claim backed by assessment data
- Flag gaps honestly in Evidence section
- Distinguish validated from assumed

## Design Standards

The DOCX output follows professional design elevation principles:

**Typography Scale**
- Title: 24pt bold, deep blue
- H1: 16pt bold, deep blue
- H2: 14pt bold, medium gray
- Body: 11pt, 1.6x line height

**Color Palette**
- Deep Blue (#1B365D): Headers, authority
- Medium Gray (#4A4A4A): Subheadings
- Semantic Colors: Green/Yellow/Red for dimension scores

**Spacing System**
- 1" margins all sides
- Generous spacing between sections
- Breathing room for readability

## Quality Standards

Before delivery, every diagnostic must:
- ✓ Be actionable (reader knows what to do next)
- ✓ Be specific (clearly about THIS business)
- ✓ Be balanced (strengths AND problems acknowledged)
- ✓ Be evidence-based (claims supported by data)
- ✓ Be concise (no removable sentences)
