# STEP 6: Persona Development

**Time Required:** 60-90 minutes (with interviews) or 20-30 minutes (from existing data)
**Output:** Professional DOCX persona document (3-11 pages) with validation badges
**Weight in VIANEO Score:** Supports Desirability dimension (25% of overall evaluation)

---

## Overview

The Persona Development step creates evidence-based user personas that validate the Desirability dimension by documenting:

1. **WHO** are the specific users? (3-5 distinct personas with behavioral depth)
2. **WHAT** drives their decisions? (Motivations, values, current context)
3. **WHY** do current solutions fail them? (Specific gaps and pain points)
4. **HOW VALIDATED** are these personas? (Interview counts and evidence levels)

**Philosophy:** Generic market segments aren't enough for investment decisions. Committee members need to see that you've talked to real people, understood their specific contexts, and validated that your solution addresses their actual needs. This framework transforms interview data into committee-ready persona documentation.

## Why Persona Development Matters

Persona development bridges the gap between:
- **Step 5 (Needs/Requesters):** Identifies WHAT needs exist and WHO has them (role-based)
- **Step 7 (Needs Qualification Matrix):** Prioritizes needs by importance and satisfaction
- **Step 8-9 (Ecosystem):** Maps stakeholders and network positioning

**Personas add the human depth:**
- Real behavioral context (not just demographics)
- Validated pain points (not just assumptions)
- Current solution analysis (why alternatives fail)
- Decision-making factors (values and constraints)

**Impact on Scoring:**
- **5 points (Exceptional):** 10+ interviews per persona, comprehensive behavioral detail
- **4 points (Strong):** 5-10 interviews per persona, solid validation
- **3 points (Adequate):** 3-5 interviews per persona (minimum acceptable)
- **2 points (Weak):** 1-2 interviews only, limited evidence
- **1 point (Insufficient):** No validation, hypothetical personas

---

## Required Inputs

**From Previous Steps:**
- **Step 5:** Requesters table (6-10 roles) - personas represent segments from this list
- **Step 4:** Legitimacy assessment - problem context and field of application
- **Step 3:** Market maturity scores - Desirability dimension baseline
- **Step 0:** Executive brief - target market and validation status

**Research Data (CRITICAL):**
- Customer discovery interview transcripts or detailed notes
- Interview count per segment (MUST document)
- Interview dates and participant roles
- Key quotes, behavioral observations, quantified impacts
- Current tools/solutions mentioned by interviewees

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 3 interviews per persona segment (adequate validation)
- 5+ interviews per persona (recommended for strong validation)
- 10+ interviews per persona (exceptional validation)

## Critical Requirements

### Character Limits (STRICTLY ENFORCED)

| Field | Limit | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| All bullet points | 60 chars | Tasks, Pains, Expectations |
| First name | Single name | No middle initials |
| Age | Specific number | Not a range (e.g., "42" not "40-45") |
| Text paragraphs | 2-3 sentences | Each section's paragraph content |

**Validation Tip:** Use character count tool. If over 60 characters:
1. Remove adjectives first
2. Use numbers instead of words ("12-15 hours" vs. "significant time")
3. Abbreviate universally understood terms ("RFPs" vs. "requests for proposals")
4. Front-load key information

### Evidence Quality Standards

**For Score of 3 (Minimum Acceptable):**
- 3-5 interviews per persona
- Basic behavioral information
- Personas somewhat distinct
- Current solutions mentioned
- Pain points identified

**For Score of 4 (Strong):**
- 5-10 interviews per persona
- Good behavioral detail
- Clear distinction between personas
- Current solutions with gap analysis
- Pain points specific and measurable

**For Score of 5 (Exceptional):**
- 10+ interviews per persona
- Direct quotes and behavioral observations
- Each persona completely unique
- Detailed current solution analysis with pricing
- All pain points quantified (time, cost, frequency)

## Common Pitfalls (See Reference Guide for Details)

### Pitfall 1: Generic Personas
**Problem:** "John is a 25-45 year old professional who wants better tools"
**Solution:** Specific age, role, context, quantified behaviors

### Pitfall 2: Solution-First Thinking
**Problem:** "Sarah needs our AI-powered analytics dashboard"
**Solution:** Document actual problem, current workarounds, gaps

### Pitfall 3: Overlapping Personas
**Problem:** Multiple personas with same needs, different titles
**Solution:** Find what makes them distinct or combine them

### Pitfall 4: Character Limit Violations
**Problem:** Bullets over 60 characters break platform requirements
**Solution:** See character limit strategies in Generation Prompt

### Pitfall 5: Missing Current Solutions
**Problem:** "Uses various tools that don't work well"
**Solution:** Name 2-4 specific tools with pricing and gap analysis
