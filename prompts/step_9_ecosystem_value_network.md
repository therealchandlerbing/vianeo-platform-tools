# STEP 8: Ecosystem Value Network Map

**Time Required:** 60-90 minutes (or 15-20 minutes if importing from Step 7)
**Output:** FOUR documents - (1) Master Markdown Analysis, (2) Ecosystem Data DOCX, (3) Priority Targets DOCX, (4) HTML Interactive Visualization
**Prerequisites:** Step 5 (Desirability Analysis) recommended; Step 7 (Ecosystem Mapping) optional but accelerates process

---

## Overview

The Ecosystem Value Network Map transforms stakeholder data into strategic action by visualizing:

1. **WHO** comprises your ecosystem? (5 value chain positions: Enablers → Product → Channels → Buyers → End Users)
2. **WHAT** is their stance? (Acceptability: Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable)
3. **WHICH** requesters have urgent needs? (Need Level: Critical/Important/Secondary/None)
4. **WHERE** should you focus? (Priority Targets: Favorable + Critical/Important needs)

**Philosophy:** Organizations don't have needs—people do. Success requires identifying specific requesters within favorable organizations who face urgent problems. This framework combines acceptability (organizational readiness) with need intensity (individual urgency) to reveal highest-probability conversion opportunities.

---

## Why Value Network Mapping Matters

Many innovations fail not due to technical merit, but because teams:
- Treat all supporters equally (ignore need intensity)
- Focus on organizations instead of specific requesters
- Miss high-conversion opportunities hiding in "friendly" organizations
- Waste resources on favorable organizations with no urgent needs
- Engage randomly rather than strategically

**This framework prevents that failure.** By identifying Priority Targets (Favorable organizations containing requesters with Critical or Important needs), you focus limited resources on highest-probability wins.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW

### PHASE 1: Data Collection & Organization (60-75 min standalone OR 5-10 min import)

#### If Importing from Step 7:
1. Load Step 7 stakeholder table
2. Verify all fields populated (organization, role, acceptability, requesters, needs)
3. Add core product information (name, tagline, 6 features)
4. Proceed to Phase 2

#### If Collecting Fresh Data:
For each value chain position, gather:

**ENABLERS & INFLUENCERS**
Organizations providing infrastructure, funding, regulation, standards, or expertise.

For each organization:
- Organization Name (60 chars max) - The actual entity, not a category
- Role/Description (120 chars max) - Brief functional description
- Requester Name/Title (60 chars max) - Specific role or person within organization
- Acceptability (Favorable / Neutral / Unfavorable) - Organizational stance toward your innovation
- Need Level (Critical / Important / Secondary / None) - Requester's need urgency
- Need Description (250 chars max) - Specific problem they face
- Notes (250 chars max) - Context, relationship history, barriers

**CORE PRODUCT/SERVICE**
Your offering (center of the network).

Capture:
- Product/Service Name (60 chars max)
- Tagline (120 chars max) - Brief value proposition
- Key Features (6 items, 60 chars each) - Distinct capabilities

**CHANNELS & PARTNERS**
Organizations facilitating distribution, adoption, or implementation.

[Same structure as Enablers]

**BUYERS & CLIENTS**
Organizations with purchasing power and budget authority.

[Same structure as Enablers]

**END USERS (DOWNSTREAM)**
Organizations where end users work or receive services.

[Same structure as Enablers]

---

### PHASE 2: Identify Priority Targets (10-15 min)

**Priority Target Criteria:**
An organization is a Priority Target if it meets BOTH:
1. **Acceptability = Favorable** (organizational support exists)
2. **Need Level = Critical OR Important** (specific requester has urgent need)

**Why This Matters:**
- Favorable organizations with no urgent needs → Low conversion probability (nice relationship, no action driver)
- Unfavorable organizations with urgent needs → High resistance (need exists, but organizational barriers)
- **Priority Targets** → High conversion probability (organizational support + urgent individual need)

**Process:**
1. Review completed data matrix
2. Mark organizations meeting both criteria
3. Count total priority targets
4. Verify each has specific requester with validated need
5. Note priority ranking (High/Medium based on strategic value)

**Expected Output:** 5-15 priority targets across all value chain positions

---

### PHASE 3: Create Ecosystem Data Matrix (10-15 min)

Use template: `templates/Step8_Ecosystem_Data_Matrix_Template.md`

**Structure:**
```markdown
[PROJECT NAME] ECOSYSTEM VALUE NETWORK DATA
Last Updated: [Date]

PROJECT OVERVIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Project Name: [Name]
Industry/Domain: [Industry]
Core Solution: [Brief description]

ENABLERS & INFLUENCERS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Organizations providing infrastructure, funding, regulation, or expertise

| Organization | Role/Description | Requester | Acceptability | Need Level | Notes |
|--------------|------------------|-----------|---------------|------------|-------|
| [Name]       | [Role]           | [Title]   | Favorable     | Critical   | [...]  |

[Continue for all 5 value chain positions]

PRIORITY TARGETS QUICK REFERENCE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Organizations that are Favorable AND contain requesters with Critical or Important needs:

1. [Organization] → [Requester] → [Need Level]
```

### PHASE 4: Generate HTML Visualization (15-20 min)

Use template: `templates/Step8_Value_Network_Visualization.html`

**HTML Construction Rules:**

1. **Copy base template** (includes all CSS, structure, legend)
2. **Update header** with project name
3. **For each organization, apply correct CSS class:**

   **Priority Target** (Favorable + Critical/Important need):
   ```html
   <div class="player-box priority-target">
       <div class="player-title">Organization Name</div>
       <div class="player-subtitle">Role description</div>
       <div class="requester-name">Requester Title</div>
       <div class="need-badge need-critical">Critical</div>
       <div class="acceptability-indicator">
           <div class="acceptability-dot dot-favorable"></div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

   **Favorable** (no urgent needs):
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-favorable">
       <div class="player-title">Organization Name</div>
       <div class="player-subtitle">Role description</div>
       <div class="requester-name">Requester Title</div>
       <div class="acceptability-indicator">
           <div class="acceptability-dot dot-favorable"></div>
       </div>
   </div>
   ```

   **Neutral**:
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-neutral">
       [Same structure, dot-neutral]
   </div>
   ```

   **Unfavorable**:
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-unfavorable">
       [Same structure, dot-unfavorable]
   </div>
   ```

4. **Core Product section:**
   ```html
   <div class="player-box core-product">
       <div class="player-title">Product Name</div>
       <div class="player-subtitle">Tagline</div>
       <ul class="feature-list">
           <li>Feature 1</li>
           <li>Feature 2</li>
           [...]
       </ul>
   </div>
   ```

**Visual Encoding Summary:**

| Condition | Box Class | Border | Background | Badge | Dot |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|-------|-----|
| Favorable + Critical/Important | priority-target | Green (thick) | Light green gradient | Critical/Important | Green |
| Favorable only | box-favorable | Green | White | None | Green |
| Neutral | box-neutral | Orange | Light orange gradient | Any or none | Orange |
| Unfavorable | box-unfavorable | Red | Light red gradient | Any or none | Red |

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] Opens correctly in browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari tested)
- [ ] All 5 columns display with correct headers
- [ ] Priority targets show green gradient background
- [ ] Need badges appear on correct organizations (only if Critical/Important/Secondary)
- [ ] Acceptability dots match organization status
- [ ] Core product centered with all features listed
- [ ] Legend displays all encoding rules correctly
- [ ] Professional appearance (ready for screenshot/PDF export)
- [ ] No broken HTML tags or missing divs

---

### PHASE 5: Create Priority Targets Summary (20-30 min)

Use template: `templates/Step8_Priority_Targets_Template.md`

**For Each Priority Target:**

```markdown

• [Resources required]

Success Metrics:
• [How we'll measure progress]

Potential Barriers:
• [Any known obstacles]

Priority Ranking: [High / Medium] based on [conversion probability, strategic value, resource availability]
```

**Additional Sections:**
- Executive Summary (total targets, breakdown by need level)
- Engagement Timeline (Immediate/Near-term/Medium-term with specific actions)
- Resource Requirements (team members, budget allocation)
- Success Factors & Risks (what must go right, known risks with mitigation)
- Organizations to Monitor (not ready yet, but watch for trigger events)

- [ ] Each target has complete information (no TBD placeholders)
- [ ] Engagement strategies are specific and actionable (not generic)
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable
- [ ] Timeline is realistic and achievable
- [ ] Resource requirements are honest (not understated)
- [ ] Risks identified with mitigation strategies
- [ ] Information aligns perfectly with data matrix
- [ ] Targets prioritized/ranked with justification

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Pitfall 1: Organizations vs. Individuals
❌ **Wrong:** Listing "Dr. Sarah Johnson" as an organization
✅ **Right:** Organization = "Memorial Hospital System" | Requester = "Chief Medical Officers"

### Pitfall 2: Generic Categories vs. Specific Entities
❌ **Wrong:** "School Districts" as a single organization
✅ **Right:** "Austin Independent School District", "Houston ISD", "Dallas ISD" as separate entities

### Pitfall 3: Optimistic Acceptability
❌ **Wrong:** Marking everyone "Favorable" based on one positive conversation
✅ **Right:** "Neutral" until organizational support demonstrated through actions

### Pitfall 4: Treating All Favorable Organizations Equally
❌ **Wrong:** Engaging all 20 favorable organizations simultaneously
✅ **Right:** Focus 80% effort on 5-8 priority targets (Favorable + Critical/Important needs)

### Pitfall 5: Missing the Requester
❌ **Wrong:** Organization has need, but no specific person identified
✅ **Right:** "IT Directors" or "Procurement Managers" or "Program Coordinators" named

### Pitfall 6: Confusing Need Level
- **Critical** = Urgent pain NOW, actively seeking solutions, budget allocated
- **Important** = Significant problem, measurable impact if solved, timeline flexible
- **Secondary** = Nice-to-have, incremental improvement, low priority

### Pitfall 7: Incomplete HTML Construction
❌ **Wrong:** Copy-paste player boxes without updating CSS classes
✅ **Right:** Each organization gets correct class based on acceptability + need logic

### Pitfall 8: Priority Targets Without Strategy
❌ **Wrong:** Listing 12 priority targets with generic "reach out and engage"
✅ **Right:** Each target has specific approach, timeline, success metrics, barrier mitigation

## DECISION TREES

### Decision Tree: How to Classify Acceptability

```
START: You have an organization to classify

Q1: What is their stance toward your innovation?
│
├─ Expressed interest, aligns with their goals, actively seeking solutions
│  Actions: Signed MOU, attended demos, requested pilots, allocated budget
│  → FAVORABLE
│
├─ Unknown position, waiting for market proof, cautiously interested
│  Actions: Attending presentations, asking questions, no commitment yet
│  → NEUTRAL
│
└─ Has concerns, competing priorities, sees as threat, resistant to change
   Actions: Declined meetings, cited barriers, expressed skepticism
   → UNFAVORABLE
```

### Decision Tree: How to Determine Need Level

```
START: You have a requester within an organization

Q1: Is this causing urgent pain or significant loss NOW?
│
├─ YES: Urgent, costly, must-solve, actively seeking solutions, budget allocated
│  Evidence: "We're losing $X/month", "This is my #1 priority", "Need solution by [date]"
│  → CRITICAL
│
└─ NO
   └─ Q2: Would this significantly improve their operations?
      │
      ├─ YES: Measurable impact, substantial benefit, willing to invest time/budget
      │  Evidence: "This would save us X hours/week", "Meaningful improvement to KPIs"
      │  → IMPORTANT
      │
      └─ NO: Nice-to-have, incremental improvement, convenience feature
         Evidence: "Interesting idea", "Might be useful", "We'll consider it"
         → SECONDARY
```

### Decision Tree: Which Deliverable Do I Need?

```
START: What is your use case?

├─ Need to collect and organize ecosystem data
│  → Use: ECOSYSTEM DATA MATRIX (deliverable 1)
│
├─ Need to present ecosystem to stakeholders/investors
│  → Use: HTML VISUALIZATION (deliverable 2)
│
├─ Need to plan sales/BD engagement strategy
│  → Use: PRIORITY TARGETS SUMMARY (deliverable 3)
│
├─ Quarterly strategy review or planning session
│  → Use: ALL FOUR DELIVERABLES
│
├─ Investor presentation or board meeting
│  → Use: ECOSYSTEM DATA DOCX + HTML VISUALIZATION + PRIORITY TARGETS DOCX
│
└─ New team member onboarding
   → Use: MASTER MARKDOWN ANALYSIS + ALL DOCX/HTML FILES
```
