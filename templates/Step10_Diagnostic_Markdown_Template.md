## Executive Diagnostic

### Strengths

[1-2 sentences highlighting validated assets and competitive advantages. Focus on evidence-backed capabilities across the 5 proofs of value. Lead with strongest validation. Include specific numbers (e.g., "50+ beta users", "10+ years domain expertise"), names of people/partners/technologies, and concrete examples. Use evidence hierarchy: external validation > internal validation > self-reported.]

### Risks

[1-2 sentences identifying critical vulnerabilities and misalignments that threaten viability. Prioritize systemic issues over minor gaps. Be direct and specific. Quantify where possible (e.g., "zero paying customers", "3 ventures diluting focus"). Connect to specific dimension scores. No hedging language ("may", "might", "possibly").]

### Near-term Actions (30-60 days)

[2-3 sentences listing 3-4 concrete actions with responsible owners in parentheses. Format: "[Owner Name] should [specific action] to [measurable outcome]." Actions should address critical risks or capitalize on strengths. Use delegation-ready language. Be specific about numbers, timeframes, and success criteria.]

### Evidence Gaps

[1-2 sentences noting missing validation that limits confidence in scoring. Focus on material gaps that affect decision-making (e.g., "Customer interview methodology completely undocumented", "Competitive intelligence lacks depth"). Group logically by category (customer, competitive, financial, team, ecosystem). Be specific about what's missing and why it matters. Do NOT repeat information from Risks paragraph.]

| **Acceptability** | X.X/5 | [Status Keyword] - [Brief specific explanation, 5-10 words] |
| **Feasibility** | X.X/5 | [Status Keyword] - [Brief specific explanation, 5-10 words] |
| **Viability** | X.X/5 | [Status Keyword] - [Brief specific explanation, 5-10 words] |

**Overall Status:** [Status category - Promising/Strong/Developing/Problematic] requiring [what's needed]. [Key trade-off or balance statement that synthesizes strengths vs. weaknesses].

**Status Keywords by Score:**
- 4.5-5.0 = Strong
- 3.5-4.4 = Promising
- 3.0-3.4 = Developing
- 2.0-2.9 = Problematic

3. [Third urgent action - maximum 3 actions total]

### Short-term Priority (Months 2-3)

1. [First validation/capability building action]
2. [Second validation/capability building action]
3. [Third validation/capability building action]
4. [Fourth validation/capability building action - maximum 4 actions total]

### Medium-term Priority (Months 4-6)

1. [First strategic positioning/infrastructure action]
2. [Second strategic positioning/infrastructure action]

### Success Metrics

- [Metric 1 with specific threshold, e.g., "40%+ beta-to-paid conversion rate"]
- [Metric 2 with specific threshold, e.g., "<$300 CAC validated across channels"]
- [Metric 3 with specific threshold, e.g., "LTV:CAC ratio >3:1 within 18 months"]

## Instructions for Use

**Replace all bracketed placeholders** with actual content from your assessment.

**Content Guidelines:**
- **Strengths:** Lead with strongest validation. Use specific numbers, names, and concrete examples.
- **Risks:** Be direct. Quantify where possible. Prioritize by impact on viability.
- **Near-term Actions:** Each action must have owner in parentheses, measurable outcome, and 30-60 day timeframe.
- **Evidence Gaps:** Material gaps only. Specific about what's missing and why it matters.

**Quality Checks Before Delivery:**
1. Is it **actionable**? (Reader knows exactly what to do)
2. Is it **specific**? (Clearly about THIS business, not any business)
3. Is it **balanced**? (Acknowledges both strengths AND real problems)
4. Is it **evidence-based**? (Every claim supported by assessment data)
5. Is it **concise**? (No removable sentences, 6-8 sentences in Executive Diagnostic)

**File Naming:**
Save as: `[ProjectName]_Vianeo_Diagnostic_Comment.md`
Example: `Rayla_AI_Vianeo_Diagnostic_Comment.md`

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do NOT use em dashes anywhere (use commas or parentheses instead)
- Executive Diagnostic must be 6-8 sentences total across 4 paragraphs
- All dimension scores must match source assessment data exactly
- Save to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` directory
