**LEGITIMACY** (15% weight, Threshold ≥3.0) - 2 questions:
- Q1: Have sufficient resources (human, material, financial)
- Q8: Have verified with stakeholders that the problem is real

**DESIRABILITY** (25% weight, Threshold ≥3.5) ← HIGHEST BAR - 12 questions:
- Q2: Know who the users are and what profiles they have
- Q4: Verified user needs through interviews, surveys, observations
- Q5: Defined specific user segments with distinct needs
- Q6: Know the different needs (jobs, pains, gains) for each segment
- Q7: Verified through interviews with at least 5 people per profile

- Q12: Identified gaps between importance and satisfaction
- Q21: Know how value proposition compares to alternatives
- Q22: Tested value proposition with 5+ users per segment
- Q25: Know the positioning (how to be perceived vs. alternatives)
- Q28: Validated which features/capabilities matter most to each segment

**ACCEPTABILITY** (20% weight, Threshold ≥3.0) - 6 questions:
- Q3: Have mapped the ecosystem of actors (players) in value network
- Q15: Identified which actors are favorable, neutral, or unfavorable
- Q17: Identified potential resistances or barriers from ecosystem
- Q18: Have strategies to overcome resistance or barriers
- Q23: Identified partnerships needed and initiated discussions
- Q24: Know regulatory, policy, or legal requirements and have compliance plan

**FEASIBILITY** (20% weight, Threshold ≥3.0) - 5 questions:

- Q19: Tested pricing with 5+ customers per segment and validated willingness to pay
- Q13: Have a plan for how to reach users (channels) and activate them
- Q27: Can clearly articulate our unique value proposition in one sentence

**Scoring Scale (Evidence-Based):**
- **5** = Exceptional: 15-20+ external validations, multiple sources, documented
- **4** = Strong: 10-15 external validations, clear evidence
- **3** = Adequate: 5-10 external validations (minimum threshold)
- **2** = Weak: 1-4 validations, mostly assumptions
- **1** = Insufficient: No external validation, pure assumption

**Critical Rule:** Only L3 (external validated) evidence supports scores ≥3. L1 (internal) and L2 (team corroboration) evidence limited to scores ≤2.

**Calculation of Overall Weighted Score:**

Formula: Overall = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

**Dimensional Thresholds:**
- Legitimacy: ≥3.0 (15% weight)
- Desirability: ≥3.5 (25% weight) ← HIGHEST BAR
- Acceptability: ≥3.0 (20% weight)
- Feasibility: ≥3.0 (20% weight)
- Viability: ≥3.0 (20% weight)
- **Overall: ≥3.2**

**Overall Score Categories:**
- **4.5-5.0** = Strong: Proceed with implementation
- **3.5-4.4** = Promising: Proceed, strengthen gaps
- **3.0-3.4** = Developing: Conditional proceed, address gaps
- **2.0-2.9** = Problematic: Reassess assumptions, pivot likely
- **<2.0** = Non-viable: Consider pivot or validation sprint

**Critical Red Flag Patterns:**

🚨 **Pattern 1: No Customer Validation**
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews)
- Q4 = 1 (needs not validated)
- Q22 = 1 (not tested with customers)
- **Action:** STOP building. START customer discovery.

🚨 **Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness**
- Q3 = 1 (no ecosystem map)
- Q17 = 1 (no resistance identified)
- Multiple unfavorable critical players
- **Action:** Map ecosystem before investing. Unexpected resistance likely.

🚨 **Pattern 3: Business Model Untested**
- Q14 = 1 (revenue undefined)
- Q19 = 1 (not tested with customers)
- Q27 = 1 (can't articulate value)
- **Action:** Define and test revenue model. Great product ≠ sustainable business.

🚨 **Pattern 4: Resource Constraints**
- Q1 = 1 (lacking resources)
- Q16 = 1 (no committed team)
- Team all part-time
- **Action:** Secure resources before proceeding. Cannot execute without fundamentals.

**Integration with VIANEO Framework:**

**Links to Evidence Log:**
- All scores ≥3 must cite specific Evidence IDs (E###)
- Interview IDs (INT-###) link to evidence entries
- Evidence reliability (L1/L2/L3) determines maximum score

**Links to Hypotheses Log:**
- Each low score indicates hypothesis requiring validation
- Confidence levels map to scores (Low=1-2, Medium=3, High=4-5)
- Validation methods specified for each gap

**Feeds Gate A Decision:**
- Assessment outputs become Appendix C in Gate A Decision Brief
- Threshold failures trigger specific pivot considerations
- Action plans inform resource requirements

**Execution Process:**

**Phase 1: Preparation (10 min)**
- Review Step 0 (Canvas), Step 2 (40Q Diagnostic)
- Gather Evidence Log and Hypotheses Log
- Confirm all source materials available

**Phase 2: Scoring (30-40 min)**
- Score all 29 questions with evidence citations
- Calculate dimensional scores
- Calculate overall weighted score
- Check all thresholds

**Phase 3: Analysis (20-30 min)**
- Write dimensional assessments
- Identify red flags and strengths
- Prioritize gaps by impact
- Develop action plans

**Phase 4: Documentation (20-30 min)**
- Generate Markdown full report (18 sections)
- Create Assessment Results DOCX (table format)
- Create Dimension Analysis DOCX (narrative format)

**Phase 5: Review (10 min)**
- Verify all calculations correct
- Ensure all evidence cited
- Check quality checklist
- Confirm recommendation justified

**Total Time:** 45-60 minutes (can extend to 90 minutes for very complex cases)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All 29 questions scored 1-5 with evidence
- [ ] All scores ≥3 have L3 evidence cited (E###)
- [ ] All scores of 1 specify exactly what evidence is needed
- [ ] Dimensional scores calculated correctly
- [ ] Overall weighted score uses correct formula: (L×0.15)+(D×0.25)+(A×0.20)+(F×0.20)+(V×0.20)
- [ ] All 6 thresholds checked (5 dimensions + overall)
- [ ] Red flag patterns identified (4 critical patterns)
- [ ] Three output documents generated (Markdown + 2 DOCX)
- [ ] Evidence quality score calculated: (L3 count / Total evidence) × 100
- [ ] GO/PIVOT/STOP recommendation with justification
- [ ] Evidence Log updated with all new Evidence IDs
- [ ] Hypotheses Log updated with validation status

**Character Limits:**
- Needs statements: 60 chars max
- Player names: 60 chars max
- Ecosystem notes: 250 chars max
- Evidence excerpts: Verbatim quotes, reasonable length

**File Naming Conventions:**
- `[ProjectName]_Step3_MarketMaturity_Full_[YYYYMMDD].md`
- `[ProjectName]_Step3_AssessmentResults_[YYYYMMDD].docx`
- `[ProjectName]_Step3_DimensionAnalysis_[YYYYMMDD].docx`

**Documentation References:**
- Complete instructions: `docs/VIANEO_Market_Maturity_System_Prompt.md`
- Quick reference: `docs/VIANEO_29Question_Quick_Reference.md`
- Evidence checklist: `docs/VIANEO_Evidence_Checklist.md`
- Workflow guide: `docs/VIANEO_Assessment_Workflow_Guide.md`

**Tips for Accurate Scoring:**

1. **Default skeptical:** Without L3 evidence, score ≤2
2. **Cite sources:** Every score ≥3 needs Evidence IDs
3. **Be specific on gaps:** For scores of 1, say exactly what's needed (not "needs validation")
4. **Watch for patterns:** Red flags emerge from multiple low scores in related areas
5. **Desirability is critical:** Highest threshold (3.5) because without demand, nothing else matters
6. **Weight matters:** Desirability failures hurt more than Legitimacy failures
7. **Evidence quality:** Only count L3 (external validated) for threshold purposes

**Next Step:** Proceed to Step 4 (Legitimacy Deep Dive)

**Common Pitfalls:**

**Problem Definition Errors:**
- Solution-embedding: "How do we create an app..." (Fix: "How might we enable [outcome]?")
- Too vague: "Help people be healthier" (Fix: Add specifics about who, what, evidence)
- Scope creep: Problem keeps expanding (Fix: Anchor to Step 0 B2)

**Domain Errors:**
- Too broad: "Healthcare" (Fix: Add boundaries like age, geography, condition)
- Shifting focus: B2C → B2B pivot (Fix: Document current domain, note history)
- Mismatched resources: Complex regulated domain with lightweight team (Fix: Lower score, note gap)

**Team/Resource Errors:**
- Overstating capability: "World-class team" with no evidence (Fix: Use specific metrics)
- Ignoring gaps: Not acknowledging missing functions (Fix: List explicitly in gaps)
- Claiming differentiators: Standard experience as unique (Fix: Mark "No" unless truly rare)

---

**Tips for Accurate Scoring:**

1. **Default skeptical:** Without evidence, score ≤3
2. **Look for proof:** Rare expertise, unique credentials, proprietary IP
3. **Be honest about gaps:** Low scores are valuable signals
4. **Use rubrics:** Follow the 1-5 scale definitions, don't guess
5. **Evidence over aspirations:** "Has 15 yrs experience" not "Will be great..."
6. **Compare to examples:** Review scoring in user's Thinkie System (4.2) vs. Rayla AI (3.5) examples

---

**Next Step:** Proceed to Step 5 (Desirability Analysis)

---

### STEP 5: Desirability Analysis (30-40 min)

**Purpose:** Identify and structure user segments, needs, and personas

**Prompt Location:** `prompts/step_5_desirability_personas.md`

**Part 1: Requester Segments (3-10 segments)**

For each segment:
- Name (max 60 characters)
- Description (100 words)
- Population size
- Current solution used
- Validation status (# interviewed)

**Part 2: Needs Statements (5-15 distinct needs)**

Requirements:
- Max 60 characters each
- Solution-neutral
- Distinct from other needs
- Action-oriented format: [Verb] + [Object] + [Context]

**Distinctness Test:**
Ask: "Can I satisfy Need A without satisfying Need B?"
- If NO → Consolidate into single need
- If YES → Keep separate

**Part 3: Validation Matrix**

Map which segments have which needs (used for Step 6)

**Part 4: Priority Ranking**

Rank needs by:
1. Criticality (fundamental to segment)
2. Frequency (how often experienced)
3. Dissatisfaction (current solution gaps)

**Optional: Persona Development**

Create 3-5 detailed personas for top segments including:
- Demographics and context
- Current behaviors and pain points
- Decision factors and adoption triggers
- User vs. buyer distinction

**Outputs:**
- Segment definitions with validation status
- Distinct needs list (5-15 items)
- Validation matrix
- Priority ranking
- Personas (optional)

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All segments have 60-char names

**Next Step:** Proceed to Step 6

---

### STEP 6: Needs Qualification Matrix (45 min)

**Purpose:** Create visual HTML heatmap showing importance vs. satisfaction across segments

**Prompt Location:** `prompts/step_6_needs_matrix_html.md`

**Template Location:** `visualizations/needs_matrix_template.html`

**Data Required (from Step 5):**
- List of segments (3-10)
- List of needs (5-15)
- Importance ratings per need-segment combination
- Satisfaction ratings per need-segment combination

**Importance Scale:**
- **4** = Fundamental (segment can't function without)
- **3** = Important (significant impact)
- **2** = Secondary (nice to have)
- **1** = None (not relevant)

**Satisfaction Scale:**
- **4** = Very well satisfied
- **3** = Pretty much satisfied
- **2** = Rather not satisfied
- **1** = Not at all satisfied

**Priority Zones (Visual Coding):**
- 🔴 **Critical**: Fundamental (4) + Not satisfied (1)
- 🟠 **High**: Important (3-4) + Rather not satisfied (1-2)
- 🟡 **Medium**: Secondary (2) + Not satisfied (1-2)
- 🟢 **Low**: Any need + Well satisfied (3-4)

**Outputs:**
- Interactive HTML matrix file
- Priority targets identified
- Visual heatmap of opportunity areas
- Screenshot for reports

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] HTML renders correctly in browser
- [ ] All segment-need combinations rated
- [ ] Priority zones color-coded properly
- [ ] Interactive hover effects work
- [ ] Mobile responsive

**Next Step:** Proceed to Step 7

---

### STEP 7: Ecosystem Mapping (30-45 min)

**Purpose:** Map all stakeholders with acceptability ratings and mitigation strategies

**Prompt Location:** `prompts/step_7_ecosystem_mapping.md`

**Template Location:** `worksheets/Ecosystem_Mapping_Template.md`

**Stakeholder Categories:**

1. **Enablers** (Upstream suppliers/partners)
   - What they provide
   - Criticality level
   - Current status
   - Acceptability rating

2. **Partners** (Channels/distribution)
   - Distribution/marketing role
   - Reach and audience
   - Current status
   - Acceptability rating

3. **Clients** (Buyers/payers)
   - Purchasing power
   - Decision process
   - Current vendors
   - Switching costs

4. **End Users** (If different from buyers)
   - Relationship to buyers
   - Influence level
   - Adoption barriers
   - Acceptability rating

5. **Regulators/Influencers**
   - Type and influence scope
   - Current position
   - Engagement strategy
   - Acceptability rating

**Acceptability Ratings:**
- **Favorable**: Supportive, ready to engage
- **Neutral**: Aware but uncommitted
- **Unfavorable**: Resistant or opposed

**Analysis Components:**
- Overall acceptability score (% favorable)
- Risk assessment (unfavorable + critical = high risk)
- Mitigation strategies for resistance
- Relationship dynamics and dependencies

**Outputs:**
- Complete stakeholder table with ratings
- Acceptability score calculation
- Risk assessment by criticality
- Priority actions for engagement

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All stakeholder categories covered
- [ ] Acceptability ratings evidence-based
- [ ] Mitigation strategies for unfavorable players
- [ ] Critical dependencies identified

**Next Step:** Proceed to Step 8 (or stop here for Standard path)

---

### STEP 8: Ecosystem Value Network Map (60-90 min)

**Purpose:** Transform stakeholder data into strategic action by identifying Priority Targets—favorable organizations containing requesters with urgent needs

**Prompt Location:** `prompts/step_8_ecosystem_value_network.md`

**Quick Reference:** `docs/VIANEO_Step8_Quick_Reference.md` (print this!)

**Template Locations:**
- `templates/Step8_Ecosystem_Data_Matrix_Template.md`
- `templates/Step8_Value_Network_Visualization.html`
- `templates/Step8_Priority_Targets_Template.md`

**Core Concept:** Organizations don't have needs—people do. Success requires identifying specific requesters within favorable organizations who face urgent problems.

**Three Deliverables:**

1. **Ecosystem Data Matrix (Markdown → DOCX)**
   - Structured table: All organizations across 5 value chain positions
   - For each: Organization name, role, requester, acceptability, need level, notes
   - Priority Targets Quick Reference section
   - Use for: Working document, team reference, monthly updates

2. **HTML Interactive Visualization**
   - 5-column grid: Enablers → Product → Channels → Buyers → End Users
   - Color-coded priority targets (green gradient = Favorable + Critical/Important needs)
   - Need badges (Critical/Important/Secondary)
   - Acceptability dots (green/orange/red)
   - Professional legend, PDF-ready (16:9 landscape)
   - Use for: Presentations, stakeholder communication, strategic planning

3. **Priority Targets Summary (Markdown → DOCX)**
   - Strategic engagement plan for highest-value opportunities
   - Each target: Organization, requester, need, strategy, timeline, metrics, barriers
   - Engagement timeline (30/60/90 days)
   - Resource requirements
   - Success factors and risks
   - Use for: Sales/BD execution, resource allocation, quarterly planning

**Priority Target Logic:**
```
Priority Target = (Acceptability = Favorable) AND (Need Level = Critical OR Important)
```

**Why Both Criteria Matter:**
- Favorable + No urgent needs → Nice relationship, but no action driver (LOW conversion)
- Neutral/Unfavorable + Urgent needs → Need exists, but organizational barriers (LOW conversion)
- **Favorable + Urgent needs** → Organizational support + individual urgency (HIGH conversion) ✅

**Data Flow:**
```
Step 5 (Desirability) → Requesters + Needs
    ↓
Step 7 (Ecosystem Mapping) → Stakeholders + Acceptability ratings
    ↓
Step 8 (Value Network) → Complete visualization + Priority targets + Strategy
```

**Quality Checks:**
- [ ] All 5 value chain positions populated (minimum 2 organizations per position)
- [ ] Organizations are specific entities (not categories like "hospitals")
- [ ] Requesters are specific roles within organizations
- [ ] Acceptability classifications evidence-based (cite conversations/actions)
- [ ] Need levels validated (Critical = urgent pain NOW, budget allocated)
- [ ] 5-15 priority targets identified (Favorable + Critical/Important)
- [ ] HTML opens in browser, priority targets visually distinct (green gradient)
- [ ] Priority Targets Summary has specific strategies (not generic "reach out")
- [ ] Character limits respected: Org names (60), Roles (120), Requesters (60), Notes (250)
- [ ] All three deliverables align perfectly (no contradictions)

**Next Step:** Create final committee report or begin priority target engagement

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Character Limit Violations

**Problem:** Field exceeds max characters

**Solutions:**
1. Remove adjectives and adverbs
2. Use active voice instead of passive
3. Combine related concepts
4. Abbreviate where context is clear
5. Focus on core meaning, not elaboration

**Example:**
- Before (68 chars): "Healthcare providers need to easily track patient medication schedules"
- After (47 chars): "Track patient medication schedules easily"

---

### Overlapping/Redundant Needs

**Problem:** Satisfying Need A automatically satisfies Need B

**Test:** "Can I satisfy A without satisfying B, and vice versa?"

**Example:**
- Need A: "Access care remotely"
- Need B: "Reduce travel to clinic"
- **Result:** These overlap - combine to: "Access care without travel"

---

### Missing Evidence

**Problem:** No data available to score question

**Solution:**
1. Score as 1 or 2 (insufficient/weak)
2. Note "Insufficient data: [specific gap]"
3. Flag for follow-up questions
4. Include in final recommendation conditions

---

### High Scores Without Evidence

**Problem:** Evaluator wants to score 4-5 but has no external validation

**Solution:**
1. Default to maximum score of 2-3 without external evidence
2. Add note: "Claim requires validation: [specific evidence needed]"
3. Classify as assumption not fact
4. Flag as key due diligence item

---

### Generic or Solution-Embedded Problem Statements

**Problem:** "Need a mobile app for healthcare scheduling"

**Fixes:**
1. Remove solution: "Need a mobile app" → remove
2. Add measurability: "for healthcare scheduling" → "to reduce appointment no-shows by 30%"
3. Specify population: Add "for rural patients"
4. **Result:** "Rural patients need to reduce appointment no-shows by 30%"
