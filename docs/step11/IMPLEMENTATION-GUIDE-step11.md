## Introduction

### What is Step 11?

Step 11 (Features & Needs/Feasibility) is a critical phase in the Vianeo Innovation Framework where you map product features to:
- Customer needs (which requesters benefit)
- External dependencies (partners required)
- Internal resources (means available)
- Implementation timelines (when features can be delivered)

### What You'll Build

A professional, interactive HTML dashboard that:
- Displays features mapped to partners AND means (toggle between views)
- Shows implementation timing for each feature
- Indicates opportunity levels through color-coded rows
- Exports data to CSV for further analysis
- Prints professionally for stakeholder presentations
- Works offline (fully self-contained file)
- Meets WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards

### Time Investment

- **First time**: 2-3 hours (including data gathering)
- **Subsequent matrices**: 30-60 minutes
- **Updates to existing matrix**: 10-15 minutes

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools

- Text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, Notepad++, or even Notepad)
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Basic understanding of HTML structure (helpful but not required)

### Required Files

From your skill package:
1. `SKILL.md` - Complete skill documentation
2. `step11-features-needs-TEMPLATE.html` - Base template
3. `vianeo-step11-matrix-styles.css` - Standalone CSS reference
4. `QUICK-REFERENCE-step11.md` - Quick reference guide
5. `DATA-PLANNING-WORKSHEET-step11.md` - Data organization worksheet

### Knowledge Requirements

- Understanding of your project's features and requirements
- Awareness of external partners and dependencies
- Knowledge of internal resources and constraints
- Implementation timeline estimates

---

## Phase 1: Planning & Data Collection

Complete the Data Planning Worksheet to organize all your data before building.

### Step 1.1: Complete the Worksheet

Work through:
- Project information
- Features list (10-12)
- Partner categories (5-7)
- Means categories (7-10)
- Relationship mapping

### Step 1.2: Validate Your Data

Verify all features have timing and opportunity levels assigned.

### Step 1.3: Get Stakeholder Buy-In

Review with technical leads, business development, and product managers.

---

## Phase 2: Setup & Configuration

### Step 2.1: Duplicate the Template

Copy `step11-features-needs-TEMPLATE.html` and rename to `[project]-features-needs-matrix.html`.

### Step 2.2: Update Metadata

Update the `<head>` section with your project name.

### Step 2.3: Update Header

Customize title, subtitle, and statistics.

### Step 2.4: Save and Test

Open in browser to verify basic structure.

---

## Phase 3: Building the Matrix

### Step 3.1: Define Column Headers

Update partner and means column headers in `<thead>`.

### Step 3.2: Build Feature Rows

Create rows for each feature with:
1. Opportunity level attribute
2. Feature name
3. Timing badge
4. Partner cells
5. Means cells

### Step 3.3: Verify Cell Counts

Ensure cell count matches column count in every row.

### Step 3.4: Complete All Features

Add all 10-12 features.

### Step 3.5: Save and Preview

Test in browser.

---

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation

### Test These Key Functions:
1. Toggle functionality
2. CSV export (both views)
3. Print preview
4. Browser compatibility
5. Keyboard navigation
6. Content accuracy

---

## Phase 5: Deployment & Sharing

### Final Steps:
1. Quality check
2. Add version number
3. Choose sharing method
4. Provide user instructions

---

## Advanced Customization

- Custom color schemes
- Custom timing categories
- Additional statistics
- Text descriptions vs checkmarks

---

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- Toggle not working
- Columns misaligned
- Export fails
- Visual inconsistencies
- Print issues

---

## Best Practices

1. Complete planning worksheet first
2. Get stakeholder approval
3. Test incrementally
4. Version your files
5. Document changes
6. Keep consistent structure
7. Test across browsers
8. Maintain accessibility

---
