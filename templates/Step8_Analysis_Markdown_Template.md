## Section 8: ECOSYSTEM COMPOSITION ANALYSIS

### Distribution by Acceptability

| Acceptability | Count | Percentage | Interpretation |
|---------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Favorable | [#] | [%] | [What this means for your strategy] |
| Neutral | [#] | [%] | [What this means for your strategy] |
| Unfavorable | [#] | [%] | [What this means for your strategy] |
| **Total** | [#] | 100% | |

### Distribution by Need Level

| Need Level | Count | Percentage | Interpretation |
|------------|-------|------------|----------------|
| Critical | [#] | [%] | [Organizations with urgent pain] |
| Important | [#] | [%] | [Organizations with significant needs] |
| Secondary | [#] | [%] | [Organizations with minor needs] |
| None | [#] | [%] | [Supportive but no urgent needs] |
| **Total** | [#] | 100% | |

### Strategic Insights

**Conversion Opportunity:**
[Analysis of priority target concentration. Example: "Heavy concentration in Buyers (7 priority targets) suggests direct sales will be most effective. Limited priority targets in Channels (2) indicates partnership strategy needs development."]

**Ecosystem Risk:**
[Analysis of unfavorable critical players. Example: "3 unfavorable organizations hold critical enabler positions (standards body, key regulator, dominant platform). Engagement strategy must address these barriers before scale."]

**Resource Allocation Recommendation:**
[Based on priority target distribution. Example: "Focus 80% of BD resources on 8 priority targets in Buyers/End Users. Allocate 15% to converting 5 neutral organizations with Critical needs. 5% to relationship building with favorable enablers."]
