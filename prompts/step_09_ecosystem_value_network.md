# STEP 9: Ecosystem Value Network Map

**Time Required:** 30-60 minutes for HTML visualization (primary output)
**Primary Output:** HTML Interactive Visualization (styled, presentation-ready)
**Secondary Outputs:** (Optional, on request) Markdown Analysis, DOCX Data Tables, Priority Targets Summary
**Prerequisites:** Step 5 (Desirability Analysis) recommended; Step 7 (Ecosystem Mapping) optional but accelerates process

---

## Overview

The Ecosystem Value Network Map transforms stakeholder data into strategic action by visualizing:

1. **WHO** comprises your ecosystem? (5 value chain positions: Enablers → Product → Channels → Buyers → End Users)
2. **WHAT** is their stance? (Acceptability: Favorable/Neutral/Unfavorable)
3. **WHICH** requesters have urgent needs? (Need Level: Critical/Important/None)
4. **WHERE** should you focus? (Priority Targets: Favorable + Critical/Important needs)

**Philosophy:** Organizations don't have needs—people do. Success requires identifying specific requesters within favorable organizations who face urgent problems. This framework combines acceptability (organizational readiness) with need intensity (individual urgency) to reveal highest-probability conversion opportunities.

## Documentation Package

A comprehensive Value Network Map Documentation Package is available at:
`docs/value_network_map/`

This package includes:
1. **README.md** - System overview and getting started guide
2. **value_network_implementation_guide.md** - Complete workflow guide
3. **value_network_quick_reference.md** - Decision trees and categorization guidance
4. **value_network_map_build_guide.md** - Technical specifications
5. **value_network_cheat_sheet.md** - One-page quick reference
6. **value_network_map_template.html** - Ready-to-use HTML template

**For first-time users:** Review the Implementation Guide before starting
**For experienced users:** Use the Quick Reference and Cheat Sheet

## Why Value Network Mapping Matters

Many innovations fail not due to technical merit, but because teams:
- Treat all supporters equally (ignore need intensity)
- Focus on organizations instead of specific requesters
- Miss high-conversion opportunities hiding in "friendly" organizations
- Waste resources on favorable organizations with no urgent needs
- Engage randomly rather than strategically

**This framework prevents that failure.** By identifying Priority Targets (Favorable organizations containing requesters with Critical or Important needs), you focus limited resources on highest-probability wins.

## EXECUTION WORKFLOW: HTML-FIRST APPROACH

**Priority:** Generate the HTML visualization FIRST. Other outputs only if requested.

### PHASE 1: Stakeholder Mapping & Data Collection (20-30 min)

#### If Importing from Step 7:
1. Load Step 7 stakeholder table
2. Verify all fields populated (organization, role, acceptability, requesters, needs)
3. Add core product information (name, tagline, 6 features)
4. Proceed to Phase 2

#### If Collecting Fresh Data:
For each value chain position, gather:

**ENABLERS & INFLUENCERS**
Organizations providing infrastructure, funding, regulation, standards, or expertise.

For each organization:
- Organization Name (60 chars max) - The actual entity, not a category
- Role/Description (120 chars max) - Brief functional description
- Requester Name/Title (60 chars max) - Specific role or person within organization
- Acceptability (Favorable / Neutral / Unfavorable) - Organizational stance toward your innovation
- Need Level (Critical / Important / Secondary / None) - Requester's need urgency
- Need Description (250 chars max) - Specific problem they face
- Notes (250 chars max) - Context, relationship history, barriers

**CORE PRODUCT/SERVICE**

**BUYERS & CLIENTS**
Organizations with purchasing power and budget authority.

[Same structure as Enablers]

**END USERS (DOWNSTREAM)**
Organizations where end users work or receive services.

[Same structure as Enablers]

---

### PHASE 2: Determine Box States & Priority Targets (10-15 min)

**Reference:** `docs/value_network_map/value_network_quick_reference.md`

**For Each Stakeholder, Determine:**

1. **Acceptability Status:**
   - Favorable: Supportive, engaged, sees value
   - Neutral: Aware but uncommitted, needs convincing
   - Unfavorable: Resistant, concerned, negatively impacted

2. **Need Status:**
   - CRITICAL NEED: Urgent end user needs (red badge)
   - NEED: Important partner/buyer requirements (orange badge)
   - No immediate unmet needs (no badge)

3. **Box State Logic:**
   ```
   IF Favorable + Has Need → Priority Box (box-priority, green border 4px)
   ELSE IF Favorable + No Need → Favorable Box (box-favorable, light green)
   ELSE IF Neutral → Neutral Box (box-neutral, light yellow)
   ELSE IF Unfavorable → Unfavorable Box (box-unfavorable, light red)
   ```

**Priority Target Criteria:**
- Favorable + Need = PRIORITY TARGET (green highlighted boxes)
- Expected: 5-15 priority targets across all columns

---

### PHASE 3: Generate HTML Visualization (20-30 min) **[PRIMARY DELIVERABLE]**

**Template:** `docs/value_network_map/value_network_map_template.html`

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **Open Template in Text Editor**
   - Use VS Code, Sublime, or any text editor
   - Search for `<!-- EDIT:` to find all customization points

2. **Update Header**
   ```html
   <h1><!-- EDIT: Project Name Value Network --></h1>
   <p><!-- EDIT: Ecosystem Analysis & Stakeholder Mapping --></p>
   ```

3. **Update Core Product (Column 2)**
   ```html
   <div class="player-title"><!-- Your Product Name --></div>
   <div class="player-content">
       <!-- Brief description -->
       <ul class="feature-list">
           <li><!-- Feature 1 --></li>
           <!-- 4-8 features total -->
       </ul>
   </div>
   ```

4. **For Each Stakeholder in Each Column:**

   **Priority Box Example (Favorable + Need):**
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-priority">
       <span class="need-badge badge-need">NEED</span>
       <div class="player-title">Organization Name</div>

   </div>
   ```

   **Neutral**:
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-neutral">
       [Same structure, dot-neutral]
   </div>
   ```

   **Unfavorable**:
   ```html
   <div class="player-box box-unfavorable">
       [Same structure, dot-unfavorable]
   </div>
   ```

4. **Core Product section:**
   ```html
   <div class="player-box core-product">
       <div class="player-title">Product Name</div>
       <div class="player-subtitle">Tagline</div>
       <ul class="feature-list">
           <li>Feature 1</li>
           <li>Feature 2</li>
           [...]
       </ul>
   </div>
   ```

**Visual Encoding Summary:**

| Condition | Box Class | Border | Background | Badge | Dot |
|-----------|-----------|--------|------------|-------|-----|
| Favorable + Critical/Important | priority-target | Green (thick) | Light green gradient | Critical/Important | Green |
| Favorable only | box-favorable | Green | White | None | Green |

## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Pitfall 1: Organizations vs. Individuals
❌ **Wrong:** Listing "Dr. Sarah Johnson" as an organization
✅ **Right:** Organization = "Memorial Hospital System" | Requester = "Chief Medical Officers"

### Pitfall 2: Generic Categories vs. Specific Entities
❌ **Wrong:** "School Districts" as a single organization
✅ **Right:** "Austin Independent School District", "Houston ISD", "Dallas ISD" as separate entities

### Pitfall 3: Optimistic Acceptability
❌ **Wrong:** Marking everyone "Favorable" based on one positive conversation
✅ **Right:** "Neutral" until organizational support demonstrated through actions

### Pitfall 4: Treating All Favorable Organizations Equally
❌ **Wrong:** Engaging all 20 favorable organizations simultaneously
✅ **Right:** Focus 80% effort on 5-8 priority targets (Favorable + Critical/Important needs)

### Pitfall 5: Missing the Requester
❌ **Wrong:** Organization has need, but no specific person identified
✅ **Right:** "IT Directors" or "Procurement Managers" or "Program Coordinators" named

### Pitfall 6: Confusing Need Level
- **Critical** = Urgent pain NOW, actively seeking solutions, budget allocated
- **Important** = Significant problem, measurable impact if solved, timeline flexible
- **Secondary** = Nice-to-have, incremental improvement, low priority

### Pitfall 7: Incomplete HTML Construction
❌ **Wrong:** Copy-paste player boxes without updating CSS classes
✅ **Right:** Each organization gets correct class based on acceptability + need logic

### Pitfall 8: Priority Targets Without Strategy
❌ **Wrong:** Listing 12 priority targets with generic "reach out and engage"
✅ **Right:** Each target has specific approach, timeline, success metrics, barrier mitigation

---

## DECISION TREES

### Decision Tree: How to Classify Acceptability

```
START: You have an organization to classify

Q1: What is their stance toward your innovation?
│
├─ Expressed interest, aligns with their goals, actively seeking solutions
│  Actions: Signed MOU, attended demos, requested pilots, allocated budget
│  → FAVORABLE
│
├─ Unknown position, waiting for market proof, cautiously interested
│  Actions: Attending presentations, asking questions, no commitment yet
│  → NEUTRAL
│
└─ Has concerns, competing priorities, sees as threat, resistant to change
   Actions: Declined meetings, cited barriers, expressed skepticism
   → UNFAVORABLE
```

### Decision Tree: How to Determine Need Level

```
START: You have a requester within an organization

Q1: Is this causing urgent pain or significant loss NOW?
│
├─ YES: Urgent, costly, must-solve, actively seeking solutions, budget allocated
│  Evidence: "We're losing $X/month", "This is my #1 priority", "Need solution by [date]"
│  → CRITICAL
│
└─ NO
   └─ Q2: Would this significantly improve their operations?
      │
      ├─ YES: Measurable impact, substantial benefit, willing to invest time/budget
      │  Evidence: "This would save us X hours/week", "Meaningful improvement to KPIs"
      │  → IMPORTANT
      │
      └─ NO: Nice-to-have, incremental improvement, convenience feature
         Evidence: "Interesting idea", "Might be useful", "We'll consider it"
         → SECONDARY
```

### Decision Tree: Which Deliverable Do I Need?

```
START: What is your use case?

├─ Need to collect and organize ecosystem data
│  → Use: ECOSYSTEM DATA MATRIX (deliverable 1)
│
├─ Need to present ecosystem to stakeholders/investors
│  → Use: HTML VISUALIZATION (deliverable 2)
│
├─ Need to plan sales/BD engagement strategy
│  → Use: PRIORITY TARGETS SUMMARY (deliverable 3)
│
├─ Quarterly strategy review or planning session
│  → Use: ALL FOUR DELIVERABLES
│
├─ Investor presentation or board meeting
│  → Use: ECOSYSTEM DATA DOCX + HTML VISUALIZATION + PRIORITY TARGETS DOCX
│
└─ New team member onboarding
   → Use: MASTER MARKDOWN ANALYSIS + ALL DOCX/HTML FILES
```
