- [Cost item - e.g., "Accounting and bookkeeping"]

*[If minimal: "G&A costs minimal - absorbed in core team overhead"]*

---

### Fixed vs. Variable Classification

#### Fixed Costs (don't scale with customer volume)

- [Cost item 1 - e.g., "Core team salaries"]
- [Cost item 2 - e.g., "Base cloud infrastructure minimum"]
- [Cost item 3 - e.g., "Office/co-working space"]
- [Cost item 4 - e.g., "Insurance premiums"]
- [Cost item 5 - e.g., "Base compliance and legal"]

**Rationale**: [Why these are fixed - e.g., "Required regardless of customer count; must be in place before first customer"]

---

#### Variable Costs (scale with customers, usage, transactions)

- [Cost item 1 - e.g., "Payment processing (per transaction)"]
- [Cost item 2 - e.g., "Customer support (scales with user count)"]
- [Cost item 3 - e.g., "Cloud infrastructure usage (scales with activity)"]
- [Cost item 4 - e.g., "Marketing spend (scales with acquisition targets)"]
- [Cost item 5 - e.g., "Sales commissions (per contract closed)"]

**Rationale**: [Why these are variable - e.g., "Costs increase proportionally with customers/usage; pay only for what's used"]

---

### Cost Drivers

#### Driver 1: [Driver Name - e.g., "Customer Count"]

**Impact**: [Which cost categories increase - e.g., "Customer support, cloud hosting, payment processing"]

**Scaling Pattern**: [How costs increase]

---

#### Driver 3: [Driver Name - e.g., "Geographic Expansion"]

**Impact**: [Cost categories affected - e.g., "Localization, local payment methods, regional support, compliance"]

**Scaling Pattern**: [Per-market cost vs. amortized]

---

### Cost Structure Insights

**Business Model Pattern**: [Identify type]
- **Software/SaaS**: High fixed (development) + low variable (hosting, support) → Good scaling economics
- **Marketplace**: Moderate fixed (platform) + low variable (transactions) → Network effects reduce CAC over time
- **Hardware + Software**: High fixed (R&D) + high variable (manufacturing) → Volume-dependent margins
- **Services**: Low fixed + high variable (labor) → Linear scaling

**This Product**: [Which pattern this follows and implications]

---

**Scaling Implications**:
[How costs scale as business grows - e.g., "Sub-linear scaling after MVP: fixed costs amortized over growing customer base; variable costs optimized through automation (chatbots reduce support cost per user at scale)"]

---

**Break-Even Considerations**:
[High-level sense of scale needed - e.g., "With ~$200K fixed annual costs and ~$15 variable cost per customer, need ~400 customers at $49/month to approach break-even (depends on CAC)"]

## 5. BUSINESS MODEL COHERENCE VALIDATION

*Ensuring all four components align with no contradictions*

### Alignment Checks

#### Value Proposition ↔ Features

**Question**: Can the MVP features actually deliver on value proposition claims?

**Validation**: [✓ Aligned] OR [⚠️ Gap identified]

**Notes**: [Confirm or explain any misalignment]

---

#### Value Proposition ↔ Revenue

**Question**: Does pricing reflect the value delivered? (Fundamental needs should support premium pricing)

**Validation**: [✓ Aligned] OR [⚠️ Gap identified]

**Notes**: [Confirm pricing matches value intensity, or note under/overpricing concern]

---

#### Revenue ↔ Distribution

**Question**: Does distribution channel match payment model complexity? (High-value sales need high-touch channels)

**Validation**: [✓ Aligned] OR [⚠️ Gap identified]

**Notes**: [Confirm channel supports price point and transaction complexity]

---

#### Distribution ↔ Costs

**Question**: Are customer acquisition costs (CAC) included in cost structure for chosen channels?

**Validation**: [✓ Aligned] OR [⚠️ Gap identified]

**Notes**: [Confirm CAC costs accounted for, especially if high-touch sales]

---

#### Costs ↔ Revenue

**Question**: Can revenue model support cost structure at scale? (Margin potential exists?)

**Validation**: [✓ Aligned] OR [⚠️ Gap identified]

**Notes**: [Confirm path to revenue exceeding costs; note scale required]

---

### Red Flag Assessment

**Common contradictions to check**:
- ⚠️ Premium value proposition + self-serve low-touch channel (mismatch)
- ⚠️ High CAC channel + low-margin revenue model (unsustainable)
- ⚠️ Enterprise value prop + consumer pricing (underpriced)
- ⚠️ Complex product + no support costs (incomplete)
- ⚠️ Geographic distribution + no local costs (unrealistic)
- ⚠️ Recurring revenue + no retention costs (optimistic)

**Red Flags Identified**:

[List any red flags identified] OR [✓ No red flags - business model is internally coherent]

---

### Coherence Summary

**Overall Assessment**: [Coherent | Minor Issues | Major Issues]

---

**Narrative Summary** (2-3 sentences):

[Explain overall coherence, strongest alignment points, and any concerns. Example: "Business model is coherent with strong alignment between value proposition (clinical-grade home training) and MVP features (validated exercises + tracking). Revenue model (subscription) matches recurring value delivery. Distribution appropriately matches price points. Primary question is whether $49 individual pricing supports CAC given senior education needs, but facility B2B provides higher-margin pathway."]

---

## Evidence Basis Summary

**Value Proposition Evidence**:
- Competitive advantages tied to [X] validated fundamental needs
- Client benefits mapped to [Y] validated MVP features
- Satisfaction gaps from [Z] interviews support pricing

**Revenue Model Evidence**:
- Pricing approach informed by [need intensity data/comparable analysis/early willingness-to-pay signals]
- Revenue dependencies based on [partnership terms/market norms/financial constraints]

**Distribution Evidence**:

- Geographic strategy informed by [market research/resource constraints/pilot learnings]

**Cost Structure Evidence**:
- Cost categories derived from [resource requirements in PMF/team composition/partnership terms]
- Scaling assumptions based on [industry benchmarks/advisor input/comparable companies]
