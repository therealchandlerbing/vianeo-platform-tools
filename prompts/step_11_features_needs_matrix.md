## Generation Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Inputs (5-10 min)

**Confirm prerequisites with user:**

```
Before creating your Features-Needs Matrix, I need to confirm:

1. **Validated Needs** (from Step 7)
   - Do you have your 10 needs with opportunity classifications?
   - If you have Step 7 output, I can extract them automatically.

2. **Solution Features** (5-10 capabilities)
   - What are the specific features of your solution?
   - Use action-oriented names (e.g., "Automated low-stock alerts via SMS")

3. **Project Context**
   - Project/Client name
   - Brief description
```

**Extract needs from Step 7 if available:**
- Need statement
- Opportunity classification (High/Medium/Low/Expected/Accessory)
- Order: High → Medium → Low → Expected → Accessory

### Phase 2: Map Coverage (10-15 min)

**For each feature-need pair, determine coverage:**

**Mark checkmark (✓) ONLY when:**
1. Feature directly solves or significantly improves the need
2. User with this need would find this feature valuable
3. Connection is obvious (not a stretch)

**Leave empty when:**
- Connection is indirect or tangential
- Feature alone doesn't deliver value for this need
- You have to rationalize the connection

**Be conservative.** Over-marking diminishes strategic value.

**Document as you map:**
- Patterns emerging
- Critical gaps (high-opportunity needs with no coverage)
- Over-coverage areas

### Phase 3: Calculate Metrics (2-3 min)

**Required statistics:**

```
Total Features: [Count columns]
Total Needs: 10 (from Step 7)
Total Checkmarks: [Count all ✓]

Coverage Rate = (Total Checkmarks / (Features × Needs)) × 100

High Opportunity Coverage = [High needs with ≥1 checkmark] / [Total high needs]
```

**Target ranges:**
- Overall Coverage: 40-80% (focused solution)
- High Opportunity: 100% (all critical needs addressed)
- Expected: 70%+ (table stakes met)
- Accessory: <30% (scope discipline)

### Phase 4: Build HTML (5-10 min)

**Use the Step11_FeaturesNeeds_Matrix_Template.html**

**Required components:**

1. **Header with inline stats**
   - Project name and subtitle
   - Features count, Needs count, Coverage %, High Opportunity X/Y

2. **Export/Print buttons**
   - SVG icons
   - Keyboard shortcut support

3. **Matrix table**
   - Sticky header row (top: 0, z-index: 10)
   - Sticky first column (left: 0, z-index: 5)
   - Corner cell (z-index: 20)
   - Color-coded rows by opportunity level

4. **SVG indicators by opportunity level:**
   - High: Circle r="7" (largest)
   - Medium: Circle r="5"
   - Low: Circle r="4"
   - Expected: Star outline (path stroke)
   - Accessory: Circle r="3" (tiny)

5. **Legend footer**
   - All 5 opportunity levels
   - Matching colors

6. **JavaScript**
   - CSV export function
   - Print function
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+E, Ctrl+P)

### Phase 5: Create Analysis (5-10 min)

**Use this structure:**

```markdown
# Features-Needs Matrix Analysis
**Project:** [Name]
**Generated:** [Date]
**Phase:** Business Model Design (Step 11)

## Coverage Overview

- **Total Features:** X
- **Total Needs:** 10
- **Overall Coverage:** XX%
- **High Opportunity Needs Addressed:** X/X

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- [List well-covered high-opportunity needs]
- [Note features addressing multiple critical needs]
- [Identify core value proposition from coverage]

### Critical Gaps
- [List high-opportunity needs with NO coverage]
- [List expected needs with poor coverage]
- [Note patterns in gaps]

## Strategic Recommendations

### Priority Development
1. **[Feature to build]**
   - Addresses [specific gap]
   - Estimated effort: [sprints/weeks]

### Feature Optimization
1. **[Feature to simplify/defer]**
   - Only addresses [low-value needs]
   - Recommendation: [action]

## MVP Definition

### Must-Have Features
Based on coverage analysis:
- [Feature X]: Covers [High needs Y, Z]
- [Feature A]: Covers [Expected need B]

### Defer to Post-Launch
- [Feature]: Only addresses accessory needs
- [Feature]: Low-opportunity, resources better allocated elsewhere

## Next Steps (Step 12+)

1. Technical feasibility for gap-filling features
2. Resource estimates for MVP scope
3. Partnership strategy for non-core features
4. Go-to-market messaging (focused on covered high-opportunity needs)
```

### Phase 6: Deliver Outputs

**Save files:**
- `[project-name]-features-needs-matrix.html`
- `[project-name]-matrix-analysis.md`

**Provide summary message:**

```
Created your Features-Needs Matrix with [X] features mapped against 10 validated customer needs.

**Coverage Metrics:**
- Overall Coverage: XX%
- High Opportunity: X/X needs addressed
- Critical Gaps: X needs

**Files:**
[View Interactive Matrix](computer:///path/to/file.html)
[View Analysis Summary](computer:///path/to/file.md)

**Interactive Features:**
- Export to CSV (Ctrl+E)
- Print-optimized layout (Ctrl+P)

### Key Insights:
1. [Most important finding]
2. [Second key finding]

### Critical Actions:
1. [Top priority based on analysis]
2. [Second priority]

**Next Step:** Technical feasibility assessment for prioritized features
```

## Quality Validation

### Critical Checks (Must Pass)

**Data Integrity:**
- [ ] All 10 needs from Step 7 included
- [ ] Opportunity classifications accurate
- [ ] Checkmarks only where features genuinely address needs
- [ ] Coverage metrics calculated correctly

**Interactive Features:**
- [ ] Export button downloads CSV
- [ ] Print button opens dialog
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts work
- [ ] Sticky headers functional

**Strategic Value:**
- [ ] High-opportunity needs with no coverage identified as critical gaps
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable
- [ ] MVP scope is realistic
- [ ] Next steps enable execution

### Warning Patterns

**Over-marking:** If coverage >85%, likely features too broad or marking optimistic
**Under-marking:** If coverage <30%, likely features too narrow or fundamental mismatch
**Scattered coverage:** If no pattern visible, solution lacks strategic focus
**Missing high-opportunity:** Any high-opportunity need with zero coverage is critical failure

---

## Opportunity Level Definitions

### High Opportunity (Green - #0f9d58)
- Fundamental importance to requester
- Currently poorly satisfied
- Large potential impact if solved
- Core value proposition
- **Action:** MUST address

### Medium Opportunity (Yellow - #f4b400)
- Important to requester
- Moderate satisfaction gap
- Competitive differentiator potential
- **Action:** Should address

### Low Opportunity (Orange - #ef6c00)
- Secondary importance OR already well-satisfied
- Smaller impact potential
- Nice to have
- **Action:** Consider if resources allow

### Expected (Blue - #1a73e8)
- Table stakes functionality
- Must have for market entry
- Not differentiating but required
- **Action:** Include in MVP for legitimacy

### Accessory (Gray - #5f6368)
- Peripheral to core value
- Luxury features or edge cases
- Can enhance but not essential
- **Action:** Defer until post-launch

---

## MVP Scoping Formula

```
MVP = Features covering (All High + All Expected)
      minus Features only covering (Accessory + Low)
```

**Deferral priorities:**
1. Accessory features (post-launch only)
2. Low-opportunity features (if resources allow)
3. Medium features not critical for differentiation
4. Features requiring significant partnerships

## Integration Notes

### Backward References

**Step 7:** Source of 10 validated needs with opportunity classifications
**Step 5:** Need definitions, requester segment information
**Step 4:** Solution description, available resources
**Step 10:** Strategic diagnostic, risk areas to address

### Forward References

**Step 12+:** Technical feasibility for prioritized features
**Resource Planning:** Development time/cost estimates
**Partnership Strategy:** Features to outsource or acquire
**Go-to-Market:** Messaging focused on covered high-opportunity needs
**Product Roadmap:** Phased releases based on priority

---

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-marking coverage** - Be conservative with checkmarks
2. **Missing opportunity classifications** - Every need needs color-coded level
3. **Vague feature names** - "Mobile app" too generic; "Barcode scanning via camera" specific
4. **Ignoring gaps** - Critical gaps are insights, not failures
5. **Wrong metrics** - Double-check coverage calculations
6. **Static headers** - Headers must be sticky for usability
7. **No JavaScript** - Export and print are required
8. **Missing analysis** - HTML alone isn't enough
