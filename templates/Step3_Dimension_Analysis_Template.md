## Summary: Cross-Dimensional Analysis

### Dimension Interdependencies

[2-3 paragraphs discussing how dimensions affect each other. Examples:
- Strong desirability but weak feasibility = can't deliver what customers want
- Strong feasibility but weak desirability = building something nobody wants
- Strong viability model but weak acceptability = ecosystem will resist
- All strong but weak legitimacy = solving wrong/insignificant problem]

### If PIVOT:

**Pivot Type:** [Problem / Segment / Solution / Business Model]

**Rationale:** [Which dimension(s) failed, what evidence invalidated assumptions]

**New Direction:** [Specific pivot proposal with evidence]

**Validation Plan:** [What to test, how, timeline, budget]

### If STOP:
