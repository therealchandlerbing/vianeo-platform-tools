# Vianeo Main Diagnostic Reference Guide

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Dimension Score | Interpretation | Action Type |
|----------------|----------------|-------------|
| 4.5-5.0 | Strong | Monitor, leverage |
| 3.5-4.4 | Promising | Strengthen identified gaps |
| 3.0-3.4 | Developing | Address weaknesses before scaling |
| 2.0-2.9 | Problematic | Fundamental rethinking needed |
| <2.0 | Non-viable | Pivot or stop |

## Overall Status Mapping

Combine dimension scores to determine overall status:

**Promising (Most common for early-stage):**
- Mix of 3.0-4.0 scores across dimensions
- At least one dimension ≥3.5
- Critical path to address gaps is clear
- Example: "Promising opportunity requiring significant de-risking before institutional investment"

**Strong:**
- Most dimensions ≥3.5
- No dimension <3.0
- Clear market traction and team capability
- Example: "Strong opportunity ready for growth capital with focused execution plan"

**Developing:**
- Most dimensions 2.5-3.5
- Significant gaps but addressable
- Requires substantial work before scaling
- Example: "Developing opportunity requiring fundamental strengthening before pursuing growth"

**Problematic:**
- Multiple dimensions <3.0
- Systemic issues not easily addressed
- Major pivot or restructuring needed
- Example: "Problematic venture requiring fundamental rethinking of business model and approach"

## Paragraph-by-Paragraph Guidelines

### Strengths (1-2 sentences)

**What to include:**
- Validated evidence (customer interviews, revenue, partnerships)
- Team capabilities with specifics (years, prior exits, domain expertise)
- Technical differentiation (patents, exclusive licenses, proprietary data)
- Market validation (paying customers, pilot conversions, documented outcomes)

**Evidence hierarchy (prioritize in this order):**
1. External validation (paying customers, third-party testing, funded outcomes)
2. Internal validation (prototypes, beta users, team interviews)
3. Self-reported (founder claims, projections)

**Structure pattern:**
"[Product/Company] demonstrates [specific advantage] with [evidence], creating [barrier]. [Founder/Team] brings [credential] validated through [achievement]. Early traction: [metric 1], [metric 2], [metric 3], and [metric 4] proving [outcome]."

**Good example:**
"Rayla AI demonstrates strong technical differentiation with patent-pending multi-model orchestration and grant-specific training data, creating barriers difficult for generic AI competitors to replicate. Founder brings rare 10+ year domain expertise in grant strategy, validated through prior service clients who secured millions in funding."

**Bad example (too generic):**
"The team has good experience and the technology seems promising. Early customer feedback has been positive and the market opportunity appears large."

**Why it's bad:**
- No specific credentials or numbers
- Vague language ("seems promising", "appears large")
- No concrete evidence
- Could apply to any business

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] Every claim backed by specific data?
- [ ] Numbers included (not "some" or "several")?
- [ ] Names of people/partners/technologies?
- [ ] Leading with strongest validation?
- [ ] Would investor immediately see value?

### Risks (1-2 sentences)

**What to include:**
- Unvalidated assumptions blocking progress
- Misalignments between model components
- Resource gaps without clear acquisition path
- Competitive threats with specifics
- Regulatory or ecosystem resistance

**How to frame:**
- Lead with highest-impact risk
- Quantify when possible (% conversion, runway months, gap size)
- Connect risk to specific dimension scores
- Be direct (no hedging)

**Structure pattern:**
"[Primary risk] remains [status] with [evidence], indicating [implication]. [Secondary risk] creates [risk type]: [gap 1], [gap 2], [gap 3], and [gap 4]. [Tertiary risk] with [detail], raising [concern]."

**Good example:**
"Revenue model remains entirely unvalidated with zero paying customers despite operational beta, indicating critical pricing and willingness-to-pay uncertainty. Team structure creates execution risk: CTO lacks distinctive AI/ML credentials, development outsourced to contractors, no technical co-founder, and missing nonprofit executive or regulatory expertise."

**Bad example (too soft):**
"There are some concerns about market adoption and the team could benefit from additional startup experience. Manufacturing timelines may need optimization."

**Why it's bad:**
- Hedging language ("some concerns", "may need")
- Vague and generic
- No quantification
- Doesn't convey urgency

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] Systemic issues, not minor gaps?
- [ ] Risks quantified where possible?
- [ ] Connected to dimension scores?
- [ ] Direct language (no "may"/"might")?
- [ ] Highest impact risks first?

### Near-term Actions (2-3 sentences)

**Structure each action:**
[Responsible owner] should [specific action] to [measurable outcome/purpose].

**Prioritization criteria:**
1. Addresses critical risk
2. Validates unproven assumption
3. Capitalizes on proven strength
4. Quick win (30-60 day completion)

**Owner assignment:**
- Use actual names from team data (e.g., "Shawna", not "the founder")
- Use team labels when multiple people (e.g., "Leadership team (Shawna, Soufiane)")
- Be specific about who does what

**Action quality:**
- Specific enough to delegate
- Measurable outcome defined
- Time-bound within 30-60 days
- Addresses identified gap or risk

**Good example:**
"Shawna should immediately convert 20+ beta users to paid subscriptions (target 40% conversion rate) to validate $20-50 ARPU pricing hypothesis and establish first revenue proof point. Leadership team (Shawna, Soufiane) must conduct 40-60 structured customer interviews (5-10 per segment) using standardized protocol to validate needs qualification matrix and refine ICP."

**Bad example (too vague):**
"The team should talk to more customers to better understand the market. Consider adjusting pricing strategy. Continue building the product and exploring partnerships."

**Why it's bad:**
- No owners assigned
- Vague actions ("talk to more")
- No measurable outcomes
- No timeframes
- Not delegation-ready

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] Each action has owner in parentheses?
- [ ] Specific and measurable?
- [ ] Time-bound (30-60 days)?
- [ ] Addresses critical risk or gap?
- [ ] Delegation-ready language?

### Evidence Gaps (1-2 sentences)

**What to include:**
- Missing validation that affects scoring confidence
- Incomplete ecosystem/competitor mapping
- Unclear customer interview methodology or sample size
- Missing financial validation (willingness to pay, CAC, LTV)
- Unspecified partnerships or dependencies

**What NOT to include:**
- Minor documentation issues
- Nice-to-have but non-critical information
- Gaps that don't materially affect viability assessment

**Structure pattern:**
"[Category 1] completely undocumented ([specific missing pieces]). [Category 2] lacks depth: [gap 1], [gap 2], [gap 3]. [Category 3] absent: [missing metrics]. [Category 4] opaque: [unclear aspects]. [Category 5] incomplete with [gatekeepers] undefined."

**Good example:**
"Customer interview methodology completely undocumented (sample sizes unclear, no validated needs prioritization framework, buyer vs. user distinction unmapped). Competitive intelligence lacks depth: no firsthand testing of Instrumentl or Grantable, pricing comparison incomplete, feature parity unassessed, churn drivers unknown."

**Bad example (too nitpicky):**
"Some additional documentation would be helpful. More customer interviews could provide useful insights. Team bios could be more detailed."

**Why it's bad:**
- Vague ("some additional", "could be")
- Not specific about what's missing
- Minor documentation issues
- Doesn't explain why gaps matter

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] Gaps are material, not nitpicking?
- [ ] Specific about what's missing?
- [ ] Clear why gap matters?
- [ ] Grouped logically by category?
- [ ] Different from Risks paragraph?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Mixing Aspirations with Validated Strengths

❌ "Team is positioned to become market leader in cognitive health"
✅ "Team secured exclusive NIRS license and AARP validation, operational product generating revenue"

**Why?** Strengths must be evidence-based, not forward-looking.

### Mistake 2: Burying the Lead

❌ "The project has several interesting aspects including technology and market position, with some concerns around adoption"
✅ "PMF unvalidated: 250 units sold vs. 5M target market, indicating price/segment mismatch"

**Why?** Lead with the most important finding, be direct.

### Mistake 3: Actions Without Owners

❌ "Customer interviews should be conducted and pricing should be tested"
✅ "Kate should conduct 15 interviews with churned users by end of Q1"

**Why?** Actions must be delegation-ready with clear ownership.

### Mistake 4: Confusing Evidence Gaps with Actual Risks

**Evidence gap:** "Customer interviews incomplete (8 conducted, need 15+ per segment)"
**Risk:** "Target persona based on 8 interviews shows low willingness to pay at current price point"

**Why they're different:**
- Evidence gap = missing information that limits confidence
- Risk = validated problem that threatens viability

### Mistake 5: Using Em Dashes

❌ "The team has expertise—particularly in grant writing—that is valuable"
✅ "The team has expertise (particularly in grant writing) that is valuable"
✅ "The team has expertise, particularly in grant writing, that is valuable"

**Why?** User preference: never use em dashes, use commas or parentheses instead.

## Length Calibration

**Target:** 6-8 sentences total across 4 paragraphs (Executive Diagnostic section)

**If too long:**
1. Remove adjectives and qualifiers
2. Combine related points
3. Cut lowest-priority risks/gaps
4. Eliminate redundancy between sections

**If too short but feels complete:**
You're probably good. Shorter is better if substance is intact.

**If too short and lacks substance:**
Add specific evidence, numbers, names, or concrete examples.

## Dimension Summary Table Guidelines

**Score Column:**
- Use X.X/5 format (one decimal place)
- Match exactly to source assessment data
- Verify calculations if averaging sub-scores

**Interpretation Column:**
- Start with status keyword (Strong/Promising/Developing/Problematic/Non-viable)
- Add brief explanation (5-10 words)
- Connect to key finding or gap
- Example: "Promising - Strong early signals, but thin evidence base requires validation"

**Color Coding (DOCX only):**
- Green (#D4EDDA): Scores ≥3.5
- Yellow (#FFF3CD): Scores 3.0-3.4
- Red (#F8D7DA): Scores <3.0

## Critical Path Structure

**Immediate Priority (Weeks 1-4):**
- Maximum 3 actions
- Most urgent items
- Address critical risks
- Generate quick wins or validation

**Short-term Priority (Months 2-3):**
- Maximum 4 actions
- Build capability and validation
- Execute on immediate learnings
- Strengthen weak dimensions

**Medium-term Priority (Months 4-6):**
- Maximum 4 actions
- Strategic positioning
- Infrastructure building
- Prepare for next funding/milestone

**Success Metrics:**
- Maximum 6 metrics
- Specific, measurable thresholds
- Include timeframes where applicable
- Mix of input and output metrics
- Examples: "40%+ beta-to-paid conversion", "<$300 CAC validated", "NPS >50"

## Final Quality Check

Before finalizing, ask:

1. **Actionable?** Can someone read this and know exactly what to do?
2. **Specific?** Could this apply to any business, or is it clearly about THIS business?
3. **Balanced?** Does it acknowledge both strengths and real problems?
4. **Evidence-based?** Is every claim supported by data from the evaluation?
5. **Concise?** Could any sentence be cut without losing meaning?

If you answer "no" to any of these, revise before delivering.

## Scoring Interpretation Examples

**Legitimacy 3.5/5:**
"Above Average - Real problem, genuine advantages, but team/financial gaps"

**Desirability 4.0/5:**
"Promising - Strong customer validation with 50+ interviews, needs refinement on pricing"

**Acceptability 2.8/5:**
"Problematic - Key ecosystem gatekeepers undefined, regulatory uncertainty high"

**Feasibility 3.2/5:**
"Developing - Technical capability adequate, operational execution unproven"

**Viability 2.0/5:**
