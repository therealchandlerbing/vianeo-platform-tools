## VIANEO CANVAS EXTRACTION

### 1. FOUNDATION

**Problem Statement** (MAX 250 CHARACTERS)

Write a solution-neutral statement of the problem being addressed.

**Requirements:**
- Focus on measurable issues, not proposed solutions
- NO technology or product mentions
- Specific population identified
- Quantifiable when possible

**Example:**
- ❌ BAD: "We need a mobile app to help patients schedule appointments"
- ✅ GOOD: "Rural patients miss 30% of appointments due to scheduling conflicts and transportation barriers"

**Field of Application** (MAX 60 CHARACTERS)

Specific domain or context, not generic sector.

**Requirements:**
- Narrow and specific
- Not just "Healthcare" but "Rural primary care clinics"
- Not just "Education" but "K-5 STEM curriculum"

**Project Genesis** (MAX 250 CHARACTERS)

Origin story showing the team's unique approach or insight.

**Requirements:**
- Why THIS team for THIS problem
- Personal connection or domain expertise
- What insight led to this approach

### 2. USERS AND CLIENTS

**Users** (List with 60 char limit each)

Primary user segment:
- [Name of segment - 60 chars max]

Secondary user segment:
- [Name of segment - 60 chars max]

Additional user segments (if relevant):
- [Name of segment - 60 chars max]

**Clients/Buyers** (List with 60 char limit each)

Primary buyer segment:
- [Name of segment - 60 chars max]

Secondary buyer segment:
- [Name of segment - 60 chars max]

Additional buyer segments (if relevant):

**Important Note:** Users ≠ Buyers in many cases
- Example: Children use educational app, parents/schools buy it
- Example: Patients use health service, insurance companies buy it

---

### 3. NEEDS

**User Needs** (MAX 60 CHARACTERS each, 5-15 distinct needs)

Format: **[Action verb] + [object] + [context if needed]**

**Requirements:**
Each need must be:
- **Distinct**: Satisfying one doesn't automatically satisfy another
- **Solution-neutral**: No mention of specific technology or product
- **Measurable or observable**: Can verify if need is met
- **Action-oriented**: Starts with verb

**Good Examples:**
- "Track medication schedules easily"
- "Reduce diagnostic wait times"
- "Access care remotely from rural areas"
- "Collaborate with team members in real-time"
- "Manage project budgets under $10K"

**Bad Examples:**
- ❌ "Use our platform" (not solution-neutral)
- ❌ "Be happy" (not measurable/actionable)
- ❌ "Have good experience" (vague)

**Distinctness Test:**

For each pair of needs, ask: "Can I satisfy Need A without satisfying Need B?"
- If NO → Consolidate into single need
- If YES → Keep separate

**Target:** Identify 5-15 distinct needs

## COMMON ISSUES TO AVOID

### Character Limit Violations

**Fix:**
- Remove adjectives and adverbs
- Use active voice
- Combine related ideas
- Abbreviate where clear

**Example:**
- Before (78 chars): "Healthcare providers in rural areas need to easily track their patient medication schedules"
- After (59 chars): "Rural providers need to track patient medication easily"

### Solution-Embedded Problem Statements

**Fix:**
- Remove technology references
- Focus on outcome needed, not tool
- Add measurability

**Example:**
- Before: "Patients need a mobile app for appointment scheduling"
- After: "Patients need to reduce appointment no-shows by 30%"

### Overlapping Needs

**Fix:**
- Apply distinctness test
- Consolidate if one satisfies the other
- Make each need independent

**Example:**
- Need A: "Access care remotely"
- Need B: "Reduce travel to clinic"
- **Fixed**: Combine to "Access care without travel" (they're the same need)

### Missing Evidence

**Fix:**
- Explicitly note "No data" or "Assumed"
- Don't inflate or assume validation exists
- Be honest about gaps

**Example:**
- ❌ Don't say: "Users need this" (implies validation)
- ✅ Do say: "Assumed user need (0 interviews conducted)"
