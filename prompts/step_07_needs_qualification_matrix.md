# STEP 6: Needs Qualification Matrix & Analysis Report

**Time Required:** 45-90 minutes
**Output:** TWO deliverables - (1) Needs Qualification Matrix (Landscape HTML/PDF), (2) Comprehensive Analysis Report (Portrait HTML/PDF, 9-12 pages)
**Prerequisite:** Step 5 Desirability - Needs/Requesters Analysis must be complete

---

## Overview

Step 6 transforms the Needs/Requesters analysis from Step 5 into two powerful visual and strategic deliverables:

1. **Needs Qualification Matrix** - Visual dashboard showing importance vs. satisfaction across all segment/need combinations
2. **Needs Analysis Report** - Comprehensive 9-12 page strategic analysis with actionable recommendations

**Purpose:** These deliverables identify market opportunities where high-importance needs have low satisfaction with existing solutions, providing clear prioritization for product development and validation activities.

---

## Why This Step Matters

The Needs Qualification Matrix and Analysis Report serve different but complementary purposes:

**Matrix (Visual Overview):**
- Shows all segment/need combinations at a glance
- Identifies opportunity zones (Fundamental + Not At All = priority)
- Reveals patterns across segments (horizontal, vertical, diagonal)
- Tracks validation status via interview counts
- Used in: Presentations, board meetings, team alignment

**Report (Strategic Analysis):**
- Provides context and evidence for matrix patterns
- Translates insights into actionable recommendations
- Assigns ownership and deadlines
- Sets success criteria and decision gates
- Used in: Planning, resource allocation, investor updates

Together, they force honest assessment of validation status and create clear accountability for next steps.

## Output 1: Needs Qualification Matrix

### Specifications

**Format:**
- Orientation: US Letter Landscape (11" × 8.5")
- Background: Gradient (purple to blue: #667eea to #764ba2)
- Container: White dashboard with rounded corners
- Typography: System fonts (Apple/BlinkMacSystemFont/Segoe UI/Roboto)

**Required Sections:**
1. Header with project name + "Needs Qualification Matrix"
2. Subtitle: "Visual Assessment of Importance & Satisfaction Across Requester Segments"
3. Validation notice (if pre-validation): "⚠ PRE-VALIDATION HYPOTHESIS - REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC INTERVIEW VALIDATION"
4. Two legend sections side-by-side (Importance Level | Satisfaction Level)
5. Matrix table with color-coded cells
6. Footer with project info, evidence basis, next steps

### Matrix Structure

**Rows:** Needs (10-12 from Step 5)
- Each need statement (max 60 characters)
- Numbered 1-12
- Left column with light gray background

**Columns:** Requester Segments (6-9 from Step 5)
- Segment name in header
- Interview status badge (e.g., "5 Interviews", "0 Interviews", "10+ interviewed")
- Each column represents a requester role

**Cells:** Two stacked indicator boxes
```
┌─────────────────┐
│  [FUNDAMENTAL]  │  ← Top: Importance (colored background)
│                 │
│  [NOT AT ALL]   │  ← Bottom: Satisfaction (colored background)
└─────────────────┘
```

### Rating Scales

**Importance Levels (How critical is this need?):**
- **Fundamental** (#dc3545 red): Critical, non-negotiable need. Business fails without this.
- **Important** (#fd7e14 orange): Significant need, high priority. Major impact on success.
- **Secondary** (#ffc107 yellow): Useful but not essential. Nice-to-have.
- **None** (#6c757d gray): Not relevant to this segment at all.
- **Don't Know** (#e9ecef light gray): Insufficient data to determine importance.

**Satisfaction Levels (How well do CURRENT solutions meet this need?):**
- **Very Well** (#28a745 green): Current solutions meet need effectively. No major gaps.
- **Pretty Much** (#20c997 teal): Current solutions adequately address need. Minor gaps.
- **Rather Not** (#ffc107 yellow): Current solutions poorly address need. Significant gaps.
- **Not At All** (#dc3545 red): Current solutions fail to meet need. Complete gap.
- **N/A** (#e9ecef light gray): Used when importance is "None" (need doesn't apply).
- **Don't Know** (#e9ecef light gray): Insufficient data to determine satisfaction.

**Critical Rule:** When importance is "None", satisfaction MUST be "N/A"

### Color Strategy

The intentional color overlap creates visual opportunity identification:
- **Red + Red** (Fundamental + Not At All) = Critical opportunity zone
- **Orange/Red + Yellow/Red** (Important + Rather Not/Not At All) = Strong opportunity
- **Light Gray clusters** (Don't Know) = Research gaps requiring immediate attention
- **Green areas** (Very Well) = Lower priority for innovation

### Footer Content

**Three Required Elements:**
1. **Title Line:** "[Project Name] System | Vianeo Business Validation Sprint"

2. **Evidence Description:** How the matrix was generated
   - Example: "Pre-validation hypothesis matrix generated from strategic analysis, policy research, technical gap assessment, and institutional knowledge (30+ years materials science)."

3. **Evidence Basis:** Specific sources of confidence

## Execution Process

### Phase 1: Data Collection (10-15 min)

**Gather from Step 5:**
- Complete requesters table with interview counts
- Full needs list (10 needs with categorization)
- Existing solutions analysis
- Evidence gaps identified

**Gather Additional Context:**
- Beta user count and engagement data
- Efficacy metrics (time reduction, quality improvement, documented outcomes)
- Partnerships or paying customers (even if $0)
- Revenue potential per segment ($X/mo or $XK/yr)
- Budget constraints for validation activities
- Risk identification from discovery calls
- Decision-maker names/roles

### Phase 2: Analyze Matrix Data (10-15 min)

**For Each Need/Segment Combination, Determine:**

**Importance Level:**
- Based on Step 5 requesters analysis
- Consider: Is this need critical, significant, useful, or irrelevant to this segment?
- Use "Don't Know" honestly when lacking data
- Mark "None" only when truly not applicable

**Satisfaction Level:**
- Based on Step 5 existing solutions analysis
- Rate CURRENT market solutions, not your future product
- Consider: How well do existing solutions meet this need TODAY?
- Use "Don't Know" when insufficient competitive data
- Use "N/A" only when importance is "None"

**Validation Rule:** Every rating requires evidence from Step 5 or research. If you can't cite evidence, use "Don't Know" and flag for research.

### Phase 3: Identify Patterns (5-10 min)

**Hot Opportunities (Priority 1):**
- Importance: Fundamental
- Satisfaction: Not At All or Rather Not
- Multiple segments affected
- High revenue potential

**Strong Opportunities (Priority 2):**
- Importance: Important
- Satisfaction: Not At All or Rather Not
- Clear improvement potential

**Research Gaps:**
- Any "Don't Know" ratings
- Clusters of uncertainty
- Require immediate interview validation

**Pattern Types:**
- **Horizontal:** Need poorly met across ALL segments (systemic market failure)
- **Vertical:** Segment has many unmet needs (underserved market)
- **Diagonal:** Correlation between certain needs and segments (niche opportunity)

### Phase 4: Create Matrix HTML (15-20 min)

**Use Template:** `/templates/Step6_Needs_Matrix_Template.html`

**Customization Steps:**
1. Replace all [Project Name] placeholders
2. Update segment column headers with names and interview counts
3. Replace needs in first column (max 60 chars each)
4. Fill every cell with two stacked indicators (importance + satisfaction)
5. Update footer with evidence basis and next steps
6. Remove validation notice if matrix is validated through interviews
7. Save as `[project]_needs_matrix_landscape_YYYYMM.html`

**Quality Check:**
- All cells have both importance AND satisfaction
- "None" always paired with "N/A"
- Interview counts accurate
- Two separate indicator boxes per cell (not split)
- Prints cleanly in landscape

### Phase 5: Create Analysis Report (30-40 min)

**Section-by-Section Approach:**

1. **Executive Summary** (10 min)
   - Write Three-Act Structure first
   - Create Validation Snapshot callout

   - Write insight paragraph about validation gaps

3. **Market Landscape** (5 min)
   - Build Problem Definition table
   - Create Competitive Positioning table
   - Write Key Insight callout (if applicable)

4. **Segment Validation & Priorities** (5 min)
   - Build full segment table with status badges
   - Create Strategic Imperative callout

5. **Risk Assessment** (5 min)
   - Identify 3-5 critical risks
   - List 5-7 red flags

6. **Decision Framework** (3 min)
   - Create Current State grid
   - Build The Choice comparison table
   - Write Recommended Path callout

7. **30-Day Action Plan** (5 min)
   - Build Action Plan table (Week 1-2, Week 3-4, Ongoing)
   - Write Budget Allocation paragraph
   - Create Decision Gates table
   - Write Success Criteria callout

8. **Validation Status Dashboard** (3 min)
   - Create three-category framework
   - Write Final Decision Rule callout

9. **Footer** (2 min)
   - Add data sources
   - Add status summary

### Phase 6: Review and Polish (10 min)

**Matrix Review:**
- Open in browser, check visual appearance
- Print to PDF, verify landscape layout
- Confirm colors render correctly
- Check text readability at print size

**Report Review:**
- Read Three-Act Structure - complete story in 30 seconds?
- Verify all numbers are specific (not "many", "some")
- Confirm every action has owner and deadline
- Check consequences stated for all decision gates
- Count pages (should be 9-12)
- Verify no em dashes used
- Check color coding consistency

**Executive Scan Test:**
- Can someone understand situation in 2 minutes?
- Are decisions clear and forcing function obvious?
- Would this hold up in board meeting?
- Is it investor-ready?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Matrix Mistakes

❌ **Split cells or half-and-half coloring**
✅ Use two separate div elements with full background colors

❌ **Rating current satisfaction with your future solution**
✅ Rate what exists TODAY in the market

❌ **Vague need statements** ("Better workflow")
✅ Specific, measurable needs ("Reduce grant writing time by 50%+")

❌ **Missing or incorrect interview counts**
✅ Explicitly state "0 Interviews" or actual count

❌ **Using wrong CSS classes or hex codes**
✅ Copy exact class names from template

### Report Mistakes

❌ **Weak, passive language** ("might consider", "could explore")
✅ Directive language ("must achieve", "do not proceed until")

❌ **Missing owners and deadlines**
✅ "Product Lead: Quality validation, Sprint end"

❌ **Vague success criteria** ("some improvement")
✅ Specific thresholds ("40% beta conversion", "7+ quality rating")

❌ **Too many callout boxes** (15+)
✅ Use 6-8 callouts for truly critical information only

❌ **No consequences stated**
✅ "If thresholds missed → REASSESS PRODUCT-MARKET FIT"

❌ **Generic competitive analysis**
✅ Test competitors yourself, document specific limitations

❌ **Padding to reach page count**
✅ Be concise. 8 substantive pages beats 12 fluffy pages
