# Vianeo Persona Generation Prompt

## Overview

This document provides the exact template for creating Vianeo personas that validate the Desirability dimension. Follow this format precisely to ensure committee-ready output.

## Before You Begin

**Evidence Requirements:**
- Minimum 3 interviews per persona (for adequate validation)
- Recommended 5+ interviews per persona (for strong validation)
- 10-15 interviews for complex B2B segments (for exceptional validation)

**Document Structure:**
- Cover page (page 1)
- Evidence base summary (page 2)
- Individual personas (pages 3-7+, one per page)
- Maximum 11 pages total

## Cover Page Template

```
[Company Name]
Vianeo Business Model Evaluation
User Persona Analysis

[Subtitle describing project or application domain]

Prepared: [Month Year]
Validation Status: [X personas based on Y total interviews]
Evaluation Phase: Desirability Assessment
```

## Evidence Base Page Template

**Page 2 Structure:**

```
Evidence Base Summary

[Introductory paragraph: 2-3 sentences explaining research approach,
total interviews conducted, date range, and research methodology used]

Validation Breakdown by Persona:

| Persona | Interviews | Date Range | Status |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------|
| [Persona 1 Title] | [Number] | [Month-Month Year] | [Validated/Partial/Needs] |
| [Persona 2 Title] | [Number] | [Month-Month Year] | [Validated/Partial/Needs] |
| [Persona 3 Title] | [Number] | [Month-Month Year] | [Validated/Partial/Needs] |

Critical Gaps & Next Steps:

[Paragraph explaining any validation gaps, additional research needed,
and recommended next steps for strengthening evidence base]
```

## Individual Persona Template

**Use this exact structure for each persona (pages 3-7+):**

---

### **[PAGE BREAK]**

### **Persona [Number]: [Role/Title]**

**[VALIDATION STATUS BADGE - Full width table]**

---

## Formatting Guidelines

### Writing Style
- **Be Specific:** Use numbers, locations, company sizes, timeframes
- **Use Names:** Actual tool names, not "various tools" or "some solutions"
- **Show Behavior:** Describe actions, not just intentions
- **Quantify Gaps:** "15 hours weekly" not "significant time"
- **Include Context:** Industry specifics, role constraints, organizational factors

### Sentence Structure
- **Active Voice:** "Manages 12 clients" not "Clients are managed"
- **Concrete Details:** "50-60 hours weekly" not "long hours"
- **Specific Tools:** "Microsoft Word and Google Sheets" not "office software"
- **Real Quotes:** Use actual interview quotes when possible in "Others Say"

### Character Limits for Bullets

**Strategies to Stay Under 60 Characters:**

1. **Remove Adjectives First:**
   - ❌ "Spending considerable amount of time manually updating" (55 chars - but still wordy)
   - ✓ "12-15 hours weekly on manual updates" (40 chars)

2. **Use Numbers Instead of Words:**
   - ❌ "Managing multiple concurrent client projects simultaneously" (60 chars)
   - ✓ "Manage 8-12 concurrent client projects" (40 chars)

3. **Abbreviate Universally Understood Terms:**
   - ❌ "Research requests for proposals monthly for client fit" (56 chars)
   - ✓ "Research 15-20 RFPs monthly for client fit" (44 chars)

4. **Front-Load Key Information:**
   - ❌ "There is no system available to track proposal language" (58 chars)
   - ✓ "No system to track proposal language effectiveness" (51 chars)

5. **Use Parallel Structure:**
   - ✓ All tasks start with verb: "Manage", "Research", "Draft", "Track"
   - ✓ All pains are gaps: "No system", "Cannot scale", "Missing data"
   - ✓ All expectations are outcomes: "Reduce time by", "Scale from X to Y"

```
Based on [number] user interviews conducted [timeframe], I've identified
[3-5] distinct personas for [project/company name]. These personas represent
validated user segments with verified needs in the [application domain].

[Then proceed with exact persona template for each persona]
```

## Validation Statement Examples

**For validated personas (5+ interviews):**
"✓ VALIDATED (8 interviews conducted October-November 2024 via partnership relationships)"

**For partially validated personas (1-4 interviews):**
"⚠ PARTIALLY VALIDATED (3 interviews plus beta user engagement, 2-3 additional interviews recommended)"

**For unvalidated personas (0 interviews):**
"✗ NEEDS VALIDATION (0 formal interviews conducted, 10-15 needed for B2B healthcare segment)"

   - Full width (9360 twips)
   - Centered text, 24pt bold
   - Appropriate background/text colors
   - Margins: 180/180/240/240
