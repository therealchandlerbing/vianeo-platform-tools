- Provide one-sentence justifications
- Cite specific evidence or note what's missing
- Calculate dimension scores
- Identify strengths and gaps
- Recommend next actions

---

## Key Principles Across All Documents

### 1. Evidence Over Assumptions
- Score what exists, not what's planned
- Require external validation for high scores
- Default to Score 1 when evidence is missing

### 2. Specificity Over Generality
- Cite exact sources
- Use numbers when available
- Name specific documents
- Avoid vague language

### 3. Action Over Judgment
- Every Score 1 specifies what's needed
- Lower scores show where to focus
- Gaps are opportunities for improvement
- Assessment drives specific next steps

### 4. Honesty Over Optimism
- Don't inflate scores to look good
- Acknowledge information gaps
- Distinguish validated from assumed
- Be transparent about limitations

---

## Critical Success Factors

### Questions That Cannot Be Score 1

For business to proceed with confidence, these require validation:

**Q7**: Must have 5+ interviews per segment (minimum Score 3)
**Q13**: Problem must be validated by multiple people (minimum Score 3)
**Q19**: Revenue model must be tested with customers (minimum Score 2)
**Q22**: Must test with customers per segment (minimum Score 2)

If any of these are Score 1, assessment should recommend pausing development to gather this evidence.

## Dimension Interdependencies

Understanding how dimensions connect helps identify systemic issues:

**Legitimacy → Desirability**
- Problem definition shapes user needs investigation
- Weak Legitimacy suggests Desirability may be built on wrong foundation

**Desirability → Acceptability**
- User segments indicate relevant ecosystem players
- Strong Desirability without Acceptability = adoption barriers

**Acceptability → Feasibility**
- Ecosystem mapping identifies potential partners
- Regulatory requirements shape technical specifications

**Feasibility → Viability**
- Technical approach determines cost structure
- Implementation timeline affects financial projections

**Viability → All Others**
- Business model sustainability validates overall concept
- Weak Viability questions earlier assumptions

---

## Common Assessment Patterns

### Pattern 1: Technology in Search of Problem
- High Feasibility (team can build)
- Low Legitimacy (problem not validated)
- Low Desirability (no customer research)
→ Stop building, start interviewing

### Pattern 2: Great Idea, No Validation
- High Legitimacy (clear problem)
- Low Desirability (assumed not validated)
- Low Viability (untested business model)
→ Validate before building

### Pattern 3: Validated Concept, Weak Execution
- High Legitimacy & Desirability
- Low Feasibility (resource gaps)
- Low Viability (no revenue path)
→ Build team and business model

### Pattern 4: Ready for Scale
- All dimensions ≥ 3.5
- Few remaining gaps
- Evidence well-documented
→ Address minor gaps, prepare for growth

## Quality Standards

### Excellent Assessment

- Every Score 4-5 cites external validation
- Every Score 1 specifies exact evidence needed
- Justifications are clear and concise
- Dimension scores calculated correctly
- Action recommendations are specific and prioritized
- Follow-up schedule established

### Adequate Assessment
- All questions scored
- Most high scores have evidence
- Most Score 1s specify needs
