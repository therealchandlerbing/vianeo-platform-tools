## The 13-Step Workflow

```
Phase 1: Foundation
Step 0: Executive Brief (20-30 min) → B1-B7 structure + maturity stage
Step 1: Application Forms [OPTIONAL] (15-20 min) → 360 SIS or CNEN format
Step 2: 40-Question Diagnostic (30-45 min) → Team/Tech/Mgmt/Commercial (2 docs)
Step 3: 29-Question Market Maturity (45-60 min) → 5 Dimensional scores (3 outputs)

Phase 2: Deep Dive
Step 4: Legitimacy Deep Dive (20-30 min) → Problem/domain/team/resources (2 outputs)
Step 5: Desirability Analysis (30-40 min) → Segments, needs, personas
Step 6: Persona Development (30-45 min) → Evidence-based personas
Step 7: Needs Qualification Matrix (45-90 min) → HTML priority heatmap + report
Step 8: Players & Influencers (30-45 min) → Ecosystem acceptability mapping
Step 9: Value Network Map (45-60 min) → Interactive HTML network visualization

Phase 3: Synthesis
Step 10: Diagnostic Comment (25-35 min) → Executive decision brief
Step 11: Features-Needs Matrix (30-45 min) → MVP scope analysis

Phase 4: Viability
Step 12: Viability Assessment (2-4 hours) → PMF sheets, business models, dashboard
```

**Total Time:**
- **Fast Track** (0,2,4,5): 90 min
- **Standard** (0-10): 5-6 hours
- **Complete** (0-12): 8-10 hours

## Critical Character Limits

### Step 0: Executive Brief (B1-B7)

| Field | Max Characters |
|-------|----------------|
| **B1:** One-Line Description | 150 |
| **B2:** Problem Statement | 300 |
| **B3:** Proposed Solution | 300 |
| **B4:** Target Market/Users | 300 |
| **B5:** Business Model/Revenue | 300 |
| **B6:** Traction/Validation | 300 |
| **B7:** Team/Resources | 200 |
| **Supplementary Notes** (each) | 250 |

### Steps 5-12: Needs & Ecosystem

| Field | Max Characters |
|-------|----------------|
| Needs Statements | 60 each |
| Player/Segment Names | 60 each |
| Ecosystem Notes | 250 |
| Feature Names | 60 each |

---

## Scoring Scales

### Step 2 (40-Question Diagnostic): 1-5 Scale

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 5 | Complete - external validation, documented |
| 4 | Strong - some external validation |
| 3 | Adequate - internal validation only |
| 2 | Weak - significant gaps, aware but not addressed |
| 1 | Critical gap - no evidence, major deficiency |

### Step 3 (Market Maturity): 1-5 Evidence-Based Scale

| Score | Meaning | Evidence Required |
|-------|---------|-------------------|
| 5 | Exceptional | 15-20+ external validations, documented |
| 4 | Strong | 10-15 external validations, clear evidence |
| 3 | Adequate | 5-10 external validations (L3 evidence) |
| 2 | Weak | 1-4 validations, mostly assumptions |
| 1 | Insufficient | No external validation, pure assumption |

**Critical Rule:** Only L3 (external validated) evidence supports scores ≥3

---

## The Five Dimensions (Step 3)

| Dimension | Weight | Threshold | Questions | Focus |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| **Legitimacy** | 15% | 3.0 | 2 | Problem real? |
| **Desirability** | 25% | 3.5 | 12 | Customers want it? |
| **Acceptability** | 20% | 3.0 | 6 | Ecosystem supports? |
| **Feasibility** | 20% | 3.0 | 5 | Team can deliver? |
| **Viability** | 20% | 3.0 | 4 | Business sustainable? |

**Overall Threshold:** ≥ 3.2

**Formula:** (L×0.15) + (D×0.25) + (A×0.20) + (F×0.20) + (V×0.20)

---

## Critical Evidence Thresholds

### For Score 3 (Minimum):

- **Customer Interviews:** 5-10 per segment
- **User Testing:** 5-10 users for prototype
- **Competitive Analysis:** 2-3 alternatives researched
- **Stakeholders Identified:** 3-5 key players
- **Resources Secured:** 60%+ of needs

### For Score 4:

- **Customer Interviews:** 10-15 per segment
- **User Testing:** 10-15 users
- **Competitive Analysis:** 3-5 alternatives analyzed
- **Stakeholders:** 5-10 identified
- **Resources:** 80%+ secured

### For Score 5:

- **Customer Interviews:** 15-20+ per segment
- **User Testing:** 20+ users
- **Competitive Analysis:** 5+ alternatives, direct testing
- **Stakeholders:** 10+ validated
- **Resources:** 100% secured

---

## Red Flags to Watch (Step 3)

### 🚨 Pattern 1: No Customer Validation
- Zero customer interviews (Q7 = 1)
- Needs not validated (Q4 = 1)
- Value prop not tested (Q22 = 1)
→ **STOP building, START customer discovery immediately**

### 🚨 Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness
- No ecosystem map (Q3 = 1)
- No resistances identified (Q17 = 1)
- Multiple unfavorable critical players (Step 7)
→ **Map ecosystem before investing. Unexpected resistance likely.**

### 🚨 Pattern 3: Business Model Untested
- Revenue model undefined (Q14 = 1)
- Pricing not tested (Q19 = 1)
- Can't articulate value (Q27 = 1)
→ **Define and test revenue model. Great product ≠ sustainable business.**

### 🚨 Pattern 4: Resource Constraints
- Resources lacking (Q1 = 1)
- No committed team (Q16 = 1)
- Team all part-time
→ **Secure resources before proceeding. Cannot execute without fundamentals.**

---

## Needs Matrix Priority Zones (Step 6)

| Zone | Color | Criteria |
|------|-------|----------|
| 🔴 **Critical** | Red | Fundamental need (4) + Not satisfied (1) |
| 🟠 **High** | Orange | Important (3-4) + Rather not satisfied (1-2) |
| 🟡 **Medium** | Yellow | Secondary (2) + Not satisfied (1-2) |
| 🟢 **Low** | Green | Any need + Well satisfied (3-4) |

---

## Acceptability Ratings (Step 7)

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Favorable** | Supportive, ready to engage | Leverage relationship |
| **Neutral** | Aware but uncommitted | Engage and influence |
| **Unfavorable** | Resistant or opposed | Mitigate or work around |

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk:** Unfavorable + Critical player
- **Medium Risk:** Unfavorable + Important player
- **Low Risk:** Unfavorable + Helpful player
