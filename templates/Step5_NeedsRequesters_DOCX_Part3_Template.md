**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 1: Opening** [⏱ 5 min]

**Purpose:** Build rapport and set expectations

**Script:**
- Introduce yourself and purpose: "We're researching [domain] to understand challenges and needs"
- Set expectations: "This is research, not a sales pitch. We want to learn from your experience"
- Get permission: "Is it okay if I take notes / record this conversation?"
- Build rapport with warm-up question: "Tell me about your role and what you're working on"

---

### Phase 2: Current State (15 minutes)

**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 2: Current State** [⏱ 15 min]

**Purpose:** Understand their world before introducing your solution

**Explore their current situation and practices:**

1. "Walk me through how you currently [do the relevant task]"
   *→ Listen for: Process, tools, people involved, frequency*

2. "What tools or solutions are you using today?"
   *→ Listen for: Specific products/services, satisfaction level, what they like*

3. "How did you choose those solutions?"
   *→ Listen for: Decision criteria, who was involved, evaluation process*

4. "What's working well with your current approach?"
   *→ Listen for: Strengths to maintain, features they value*

5. "What would you change if you could?"
   *→ Listen for: Pain points, frustrations, workarounds*

**IMPORTANT:** Don't mention your solution yet. Just listen and understand.

---

### Phase 3: Problem Validation (15 minutes)

**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 3: Problem Validation** [⏱ 15 min]

**Purpose:** Validate problems and quantify pain intensity

**Validate the problems and pain points:**

1. "Tell me about a time when [problem] caused issues for you"
   *→ Listen for: Specific stories, emotional impact, frequency*

2. "How often does this problem occur?"
   *→ Listen for: Daily, weekly, monthly? Quantify the frequency*

3. "What does this problem cost you?" (time, money, opportunity, reputation)
   *→ Listen for: Specific numbers - hours lost, dollars wasted, deals missed*

4. "What have you tried to solve this?"
   *→ Listen for: Other solutions attempted, why they failed*

5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"
   *→ Listen for: Their priorities, must-haves vs. nice-to-haves*

**CRITICAL:** Get specific numbers. "It's expensive" ≠ validation. "$10K per month" = validation.

---

### Phase 4: Pricing & Willingness to Pay (10 minutes)

**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 4: Pricing & Willingness to Pay** [⏱ 10 min]

**Purpose:** Understand financial constraints and validate pricing assumptions

**Understand financial constraints and decision factors:**

1. "What's your budget for [category of solution]?"
   *→ Listen for: Specific dollar amounts, budget cycle, approval process*

2. "How do you make purchasing decisions for tools like this?"
   *→ Listen for: Who decides, what factors matter, timeline*

3. "If a solution saved you [quantified benefit from Phase 3], what would that be worth?"
   *→ Listen for: Willingness to pay, ROI expectations*

4. "What would make a solution too expensive to consider?"
   *→ Listen for: Price ceiling, budget constraints*

**TIP:** Test multiple price points: "Would you pay $X? What about $Y?"

---

### Phase 5: Solution Validation (10 minutes)

**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 5: Solution Validation** [⏱ 10 min]

**Purpose:** Introduce your approach AFTER understanding their needs

**⚠️ WARNING:** Only introduce your solution AFTER understanding their needs (Phases 1-4). Otherwise you'll hear what they think you want to hear, not what they actually need.

**Introduce technology AFTER understanding their needs:**

1. "We're exploring a solution that [brief description]. How does that sound?"
   *→ Listen for: Initial reaction, interest level, concerns*

2. "Which of the problems we discussed would this address for you?"
   *→ Listen for: Value proposition resonance, misalignments*

3. "What concerns do you have about this approach?"
   *→ Listen for: Objections, risks, implementation challenges*

4. "If this were available today at $X, would you try it?"
   *→ Listen for: Commitment level (yes/no/maybe), conditions required*

5. "What would need to be true for you to switch from your current solution?"
   *→ Listen for: Switching barriers, required features, proof points*

---

### Phase 6: Close (5 minutes)

**[BOX WITH LIGHT BLUE BACKGROUND]**
**Phase 6: Close** [⏱ 5 min]

**Purpose:** Get referrals and set up next steps

**Next steps and relationship building:**

1. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
   *→ Get 2-3 specific names, ask for warm introduction*

2. "Would you be interested in testing an early version?"
   *→ Gauge commitment level, get specific timeline*

3. "Can I follow up with you in [timeframe]?"
   *→ Set expectations, maintain relationship*

**Thank them:** "This was incredibly valuable. Thank you for your time and honest feedback."

## KEY INSIGHTS TO CAPTURE

**Main Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
KEY INSIGHTS TO CAPTURE
```

**Introduction Text:** (11pt, Regular, italics)
```
Document these critical data points from every interview. Use the interview template form (separate document) to capture this information consistently.
```

**Format:** Table with icon column

| Icon | Insight Type | What to Document |
|------|-------------|------------------|

**Table Style:**
- Column 1: Icons (emoji), 40px width
- Column 2: Insight type (Bold), 1.5"
- Column 3: What to document (Regular), 5"
- Header row: Blue background (#2E5C8A), White text
- Alternating rows: White, very light gray (#F8F9FA)

**Example:**

| Icon | Insight Type | What to Document |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| 😣 | **Pain Intensity** | How much does the problem cost them? Quantify in time, money, opportunity cost. Get specific numbers: "$10K/month", "20 hours/week", "3 deals lost per quarter" |
| 🛠️ | **Current Solutions** | What do they use now? Satisfaction level (1-5 scale)? What do they like? What frustrates them? |
| ⚖️ | **Decision Criteria** | What factors matter most? Who decides? What's the approval process? How long does it take? |
| 💰 | **Willingness to Pay** | Specific price points, not just "interested". Test multiple price levels. What's their budget? What's too expensive? |
| 🚫 | **Objections** | Why might they NOT buy? (price, risk, implementation complexity, inertia, satisfaction with status quo) |
| 🔧 | **Technical Requirements** | What exactly matters? (specs, integration, support, customization, reliability, performance) |
| ⏰ | **Timeline** | When do they make decisions? What's urgent vs. nice-to-have? What's driving timeline? |
| 🔄 | **Alternatives Considered** | What else have they tried/considered? Why did they choose current solution? What did they reject? |

## INTERVIEW GUIDELINES

**Main Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
INTERVIEW GUIDELINES
```

### Interview Best Practices

**Subsection Header:** (12pt, Bold, Color: #17A2B8)
```
Interview Best Practices
```

**Format:** Numbered list with bold headers and explanatory text

**Example:**

1. **Listen More, Talk Less (80/20 rule)**

   You should listen 80% of the time, talk 20%. Resist the urge to pitch or explain your solution. Comfortable silence means they're thinking - don't fill it. The more they talk, the more you learn.

2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**

   Use "Tell me about..." not "Do you...?" Use "How" and "Why" questions to encourage stories. Avoid yes/no questions that close conversation. Open-ended questions reveal deeper insights.

3. **Dig Deeper with Follow-Ups**

   When something interesting comes up, probe further:
   • "Why is that?"
   • "Tell me more"
   • "Can you give me an example?"
   • "What else?"

   The best insights come from follow-up questions.

4. **Listen for Problems, Not Solutions**

   Don't pitch your solution until Phase 5. Understand their needs first. When they propose solutions, note it, but dig for the underlying need. You want to understand the problem, not validate their solution ideas.

5. **Validate with Specifics**

   "That's interesting" ≠ validation. Get concrete:
   • "How much would you pay?" (specific number)
   • "Would you test this?" (yes/no commitment)
   • "When would you make a decision?" (specific date)

   Vague enthusiasm isn't validation. Specific commitments are.

6. **Don't Sell, Learn**

   Frame this as research, not a sales call. You're there to understand, not convince. Their honest feedback is more valuable than their politeness. Bad news now saves you from building the wrong thing.

7. **End with Referrals**

   Always ask: "Who else should I talk to?" Warm introductions >> cold outreach. Ask for 2-3 specific names. Build your network systematically through referrals.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**Subsection Header:** (12pt, Bold, Color: #17A2B8)
```
Common Pitfalls to Avoid
```

**Format:** Bulleted list with ❌ icon and bold headers

**Example:**

• ❌ **Leading questions:** "Wouldn't it be great if...?" plants ideas in their head instead of discovering real needs

• ❌ **Pitching too early:** Wait until Phase 5 to introduce your solution, otherwise you won't learn their actual needs

• ❌ **Taking "nice" responses at face value:** "That sounds interesting" ≠ validation. Dig deeper: "Would you pay $X for it?"

• ❌ **Ignoring negative signals:** When they express satisfaction with status quo, that's valuable data - it means you need a compelling reason to switch

• ❌ **Not documenting immediately:** Write detailed notes right after the interview while it's fresh. Wait a day and you'll forget critical details

• ❌ **Confirmation bias:** Hear what they actually say, not what you want to hear. Challenge your assumptions

• ❌ **Skipping pricing questions:** "Would you pay for this?" is critical validation. Don't be shy about discussing money

• ❌ **Talking more than listening:** If you're explaining and convincing, you're not learning. Flip the ratio

## TARGET INTERVIEW SEGMENTS

**Main Section Header:** (14pt, Bold, Color: #2E5C8A)
```
TARGET INTERVIEW SEGMENTS
```

**Format:** Table with progress tracking

**Table Style:**
- 4 columns: Segment, Target, Completed, Notes
- Header row: Teal background (#17A2B8), White text
- Checkboxes in "Completed" column
- Notes column for tracking details

**Example:**

| Segment | Target | Completed | Notes |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------|
| [Primary Requester Segment 1] | 10 | ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ | [Names, dates, key contacts] |
| [Primary Requester Segment 2] | 10 | ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ | [Names, dates, key contacts] |
| [Primary Requester Segment 3] | 10 | ☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐☐ | [Names, dates, key contacts] |
| **TOTAL** | **30** | **0 / 30** | **0% complete** |

**Success Target:** 20+ completed interviews (67% completion rate)

**Why target more than you need?**
- Some interviews won't materialize (no-shows, cancellations, reschedules)
- Some will be low-quality (wrong person, short duration, guarded responses)
- You need enough data to see patterns across segments, not just anecdotes
- **5+ per segment = patterns emerge**, <5 = anecdotes only

**Interview Completion Timeline:** 8-12 weeks recommended
