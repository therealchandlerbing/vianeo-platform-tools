## Common Questions

### Q: How many personas should I create?
**A:** 3-5 personas is recommended. Fewer than 3 suggests insufficient segmentation. More than 5 suggests overlap or over-segmentation. Stay within 11 total pages.

### Q: What if I don't have 5 interviews per persona?
**A:** Use orange "Partially Validated" badge for 1-4 interviews. Document this as a gap and proceed with what you have. Minimum 3 interviews is required for adequate validation.

### Q: Can I use survey data instead of interviews?
**A:** No. Surveys don't provide the behavioral depth and contextual understanding needed. Minimum requirement is one-on-one structured conversations (30+ minutes).

### Q: What if my bullets are over 60 characters?
**A:** You must edit them down. Use strategies in this guide. Platform requires 60 characters maximum. No exceptions.

### Q: What if personas overlap?
**A:** Either combine them into one persona OR find what makes them truly distinct (different contexts, workflows, tools, needs). See Pitfall 3 in Reference Guide.

### Q: How detailed should "Current Solutions" be?
**A:** Name 2-4 specific tools/products with pricing if relevant. Explain why they're inadequate. Show what gaps remain. Write 2-3 sentences total.

### Q: Can I skip "Others Say" section?
**A:** No. All sections are required. If you don't have direct quotes, infer from your understanding, but this suggests you need more interviews.
