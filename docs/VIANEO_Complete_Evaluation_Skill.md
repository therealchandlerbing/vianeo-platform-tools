# VIANEO Complete Business Model Evaluation System

**AI-Assisted Systematic Startup Assessment Framework**

## System Overview

This is a comprehensive 8-step business model evaluation system using the VIANEO methodology. It transforms raw startup applications into complete assessments across five interconnected dimensions: **Legitimacy (15%)**, **Desirability (25%)**, **Acceptability (20%)**, **Feasibility (20%)**, and **Viability (20%)**.

## When to Use This System

**For Accelerators/Incubators:**
- Evaluating startup applications
- Creating structured cohort comparisons
- Tracking progress through program milestones

**For Investors:**
- Conducting due diligence on ventures
- Comparing deal flow opportunities
- Identifying investment risks systematically

**For Advisors/Mentors:**

## The Five VIANEO Dimensions

### 1. Legitimacy (15% Weight, Threshold 3.0)

**Focus:** Is the problem real and significant?

**Key Questions:**
- Is the problem validated by external evidence?
- Is the field of application appropriate for this solution?
- Does the team have unique insight or approach?

**Evidence Required:**
- Multiple stakeholders confirming problem exists
- Data quantifying problem magnitude
- Domain expertise or personal connection to problem

**Red Flags:**
- Solution embedded in problem statement
- No external validation of problem
- Domain too broad or constantly shifting

---

### 2. Desirability (25% Weight, Threshold 3.5)

**Focus:** Do customers want this solution?

**Key Questions:**
- Have target users been interviewed (5+ per segment minimum)?
- Are user needs distinct and validated?
- Is there evidence of problem-solution fit?
- How does this compare to alternatives?

**Evidence Required:**
- Customer discovery interviews documented
- User testing with prototypes
- Competitive analysis with direct testing
- Validated willingness to pay

**Red Flags:**
- Zero customer interviews conducted
- Needs overlap or are solution-embedded
- Generic customer segments
- No competitive differentiation

---

### 3. Acceptability (20% Weight, Threshold 3.0)

**Focus:** Will the ecosystem support this?

**Key Questions:**
- Are all key stakeholders identified and mapped?
- What is their acceptability rating (favorable/neutral/unfavorable)?
- Are critical partners willing to collaborate?
- Are regulatory/influencer barriers identified and addressable?

**Evidence Required:**
- Ecosystem map with 10+ players

---

### 4. Feasibility (20% Weight, Threshold 3.0)

**Focus:** Can the team actually deliver this?

**Key Questions:**
- Does the team have necessary skills and experience?
- Is the technology proven or feasible?
- Are resources (financial, human, physical) secured or accessible?

- **1** = None (not relevant)

**Satisfaction Scale:**
- **4** = Very well satisfied
- **3** = Pretty much satisfied

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Character Limit Violations

**Problem:** Field exceeds max characters

**Solutions:**
1. Remove adjectives and adverbs
2. Use active voice instead of passive
3. Combine related concepts
4. Abbreviate where context is clear
5. Focus on core meaning, not elaboration

**Example:**
- Before (68 chars): "Healthcare providers need to easily track patient medication schedules"
- After (47 chars): "Track patient medication schedules easily"

---

### Overlapping/Redundant Needs

**Problem:** Satisfying Need A automatically satisfies Need B

**Test:** "Can I satisfy A without satisfying B, and vice versa?"

**Example:**
- Need A: "Access care remotely"
- Need B: "Reduce travel to clinic"
- **Result:** These overlap - combine to: "Access care without travel"

---

### Missing Evidence

**Problem:** No data available to score question

**Solution:**
1. Score as 1 or 2 (insufficient/weak)
2. Note "Insufficient data: [specific gap]"
3. Flag for follow-up questions
4. Include in final recommendation conditions

---

### High Scores Without Evidence

**Problem:** Evaluator wants to score 4-5 but has no external validation

**Solution:**
1. Default to maximum score of 2-3 without external evidence
2. Add note: "Claim requires validation: [specific evidence needed]"
3. Classify as assumption not fact
4. Flag as key due diligence item

---

### Generic or Solution-Embedded Problem Statements

**Problem:** "Need a mobile app for healthcare scheduling"

**Fixes:**
1. Remove solution: "Need a mobile app" → remove
2. Add measurability: "for healthcare scheduling" → "to reduce appointment no-shows by 30%"
3. Specify population: Add "for rural patients"
4. **Result:** "Rural patients need to reduce appointment no-shows by 30%"

**Score 5 - Exceptional:**
- Multiple external validation sources
- Quantified data supporting claims
- Documented evidence readily available
- Third-party verification possible

**Score 4 - Strong:**
- External validation from credible sources
- Clear evidence with some gaps
- Most claims verifiable
- Strong signals of capability

**Score 3 - Adequate:**
- Basic validation or internal evidence
- Reasonable assumptions based on data
- Meets minimum threshold
- Some external signals

**Score 2 - Weak:**
- Limited validation
- Mostly assumptions
- Aware of gaps but not addressed
- Concerning signals

**Score 1 - Critical Gap:**
- No validation or evidence
- Pure speculation
- Major deficiency
- Red flag territory

## Success Metrics

Track these to improve your evaluation process:

**Efficiency Metrics:**
- Time per step decreasing over iterations
- Character limit violations <5%
- 100% evidence citation for scores ≥3

**Accuracy Metrics:**
- Compare dimensional scores to 12-month outcomes
- Track prediction accuracy (recommended vs. reality)
- False positive rate (recommended but failed)
- False negative rate (passed but should have been conditional)

**Utility Metrics:**
- Committee finds insights actionable
- Founders find feedback valuable
- Investors use for decision-making
- Accelerators use for milestone tracking
