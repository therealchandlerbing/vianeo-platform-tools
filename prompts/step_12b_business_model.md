3. **Distribution Channel** - How clients discover and buy
4. **Cost Structure** - What must be spent

All four components must align for business model coherence.

---

## Output Structure

### BUSINESS MODEL: [Product Name] for [Client Segment]

---

## 1. VALUE PROPOSITION

**Purpose**: Articulate why clients choose this offering over alternatives. The compelling argument that makes them buy.

### Core Positioning Statement

**Format**: One sentence that combines who, what, and key benefit

**Template Options**:
- "For [client type], [product] delivers [specific outcome] without [current pain point]"
- "[Product] enables [client type] to [achieve outcome] that [alternative] cannot provide"
- "[Client type] can now [achieve benefit] through [product] at [key advantage] vs. [alternative]"

**Example**:

## 5. BUSINESS MODEL COHERENCE VALIDATION

**Purpose**: Verify all four components align logically with no internal contradictions

### Alignment Checks

**Test Each Pairing**:

#### Value Proposition ↔ Features
- [ ] **Check**: Can the MVP features actually deliver on value proposition claims?
- [ ] **Validation**: [Confirm or note any misalignment]

#### Value Proposition ↔ Revenue
- [ ] **Check**: Does pricing reflect the value delivered? (Fundamental needs should support premium pricing)
- [ ] **Validation**: [Confirm or note if under/overpriced]

#### Revenue ↔ Distribution
- [ ] **Check**: Does distribution channel match payment model complexity? (High-value sales need high-touch channels)
- [ ] **Validation**: [Confirm or note any mismatch]

#### Distribution ↔ Costs
- [ ] **Check**: Are customer acquisition costs (CAC) included in cost structure for chosen channels?
- [ ] **Validation**: [Confirm or note if CAC missing]

#### Costs ↔ Revenue
- [ ] **Check**: Can revenue model support cost structure at scale? (Margin potential exists?)
- [ ] **Validation**: [Confirm or note sustainability concerns]

---

### Red Flags to Identify

**Check for these common contradictions**:
- ⚠️ Premium value proposition + self-serve low-touch channel (mismatch in perceived value vs. purchase experience)
- ⚠️ High CAC channel + low-margin revenue model (unsustainable economics)
- ⚠️ Enterprise value proposition + consumer pricing (under-priced)
- ⚠️ Complex product + no customer support in costs (unrealistic)
- ⚠️ Geographic distribution + no local partner costs (incomplete)
- ⚠️ Recurring revenue claims + no mention of retention/churn costs (optimistic)

**Your Red Flag Assessment**:
[List any identified red flags OR confirm "No red flags - business model is internally coherent"]

---

### Coherence Summary

**Overall Assessment**:
- [ ] **Coherent**: All four components align with no contradictions
- [ ] **Minor Issues**: [Specify issues and how to resolve]
- [ ] **Major Issues**: [Specify issues - may need business model revision]

**Narrative Summary** (2-3 sentences):
[Explain overall coherence, call out strongest alignment, note any concerns]

**Example**:
"Business model is coherent with strong alignment between value proposition (clinical-grade home training) and MVP features (validated exercises + tracking). Revenue model (subscription) matches recurring value delivery (ongoing training and monitoring). Distribution (direct web for B2C, sales team for B2B facilities) appropriately matches price points ($49 self-serve vs. $29/resident requiring contract negotiation). Cost structure includes variable support and hosting costs that scale with users. Primary sustainability question is whether $49 individual pricing supports CAC given need for education (seniors are not high digital-literacy segment), but facility B2B channel provides higher-margin pathway."

2. **Undefined Revenue**: "We'll figure out pricing later"
3. **Unrealistic Channels**: Assuming viral growth without acquisition plan
4. **Incomplete Costs**: Missing support, compliance, or sales costs
5. **Character Limit Violations**: Writing paragraphs instead of concise inputs
6. **Generic Language**: Could apply to any business ("deliver value to customers")
7. **No Evidence**: Claims without validation data citations
8. **Incoherent Model**: Premium value + budget pricing, or high CAC + low margins

---

**IMPORTANT**: This business model must align with the Product-Market Fit definition (Step 12a). Refer back to PMF document throughout to ensure consistency in client, needs, features, and strategy.
