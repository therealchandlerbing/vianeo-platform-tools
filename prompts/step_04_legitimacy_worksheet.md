# STEP 4: Legitimacy Deep Dive Worksheet

**Time Required:** 20-30 minutes
**Output:** TWO documents - (1) Markdown worksheet, (2) DOCX formatted version
**Weight in VIANEO Score:** 15% of overall evaluation

---

## Overview

The Legitimacy Assessment validates the foundational justification for the business by examining:

1. **Problem Definition** - Is the problem clear, significant, and solution-neutral?
2. **Application Domain** - Is the scope appropriate and well-bounded?
3. **Team & Approach** - Does the team have relevant capabilities and exploratory posture?
4. **Available Resources** - Are there genuine competitive advantages in human, physical/intellectual, and financial resources?

**Philosophy:** Before evaluating market fit or financial projections, confirm the project starts from a solid foundation with a clear problem, appropriate scope, and sufficient means to pursue the opportunity.

---

## Required Inputs

From previous steps:
- **Step 0:** Executive Brief (B1-B7 fields, especially B2 Problem, B4 Market, B6 Traction, B7 Team)
- **Step 2:** 40-Question Diagnostic (especially Team section T1-T9, Technology Tech1-Tech11)
- **Additional materials:** Pitch deck, business plan, team bios, financial information

---

## Output Structure

### 1. Document Header

```markdown
# Vianeo Legitimacy Worksheet: [Project Name]
```

---

### 2. Core Project Information

Create a table with three rows:

| Field | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Project Genesis** | [250 characters maximum] |
| **Problem to Solve** | [250 characters maximum] |
| **Field of Application** | [60 characters maximum] |

**Guidelines:**

**Project Genesis (250 chars):**
- Origin story, founding context, how the project started
- Include key dates, founders, initial partnerships, or funding if relevant
- Example: "Initiated 2019 by Kota Ageiwa after family experience with Alzheimer's and Mitsui partnerships with Kumon. Incubated within Fortune 500 Mitsui & Co. with $5.5M investment. Scientific validation from UC Santa Barbara and Dr. Kawashima."

**Problem to Solve (250 chars):**
- Define the problem clearly WITHOUT embedding the solution
- Focus on the gap, pain point, or unmet need
- Include evidence of significance (data, user research, market indicators)
- Example: "Cognitive decline threatens independence for aging populations. Current solutions either inaccessible (clinical-grade tools) or unvalidated (app-only). 35.9% of cognitive searches from adults seeking prevention, but no affordable real-time measurement exists."

**Field of Application (60 chars):**
- Specific socio-economic domain or sector
- Be precise but not overly narrow
- Include boundaries where helpful
- Example: "Cognitive health & wellness for aging populations (55-75)"
- NOT: "Healthcare" (too broad)
- NOT: "Alzheimer's disease treatment in Tokyo metropolitan area only" (too narrow)

---

- Revenue generation (even if minimal)?
- Unusual funding sources (corporate backing, strategic investors)?
- Dependency on external fundraising?
- Runway: <6 months (poor), 6-12 months (adequate), 12-18 months (good), 18+ months (strong)

**Red Flags:**
- Running out of capital with no fundraising progress
- No revenue and no clear path to funding
- Heavy dependencies without commitments

---

### 6. Differentiating Advantages: Unique Barriers to Entry

```markdown
**Content (250 chars max):** [Synthesize the 2-4 strongest competitive moats from all resources above]
```

**Guidelines:**

## Common Pitfalls

### Problem Definition Errors
- **Solution-embedding:** "How do we create a mobile app to..." (embeds solution)
  - Fix: "How might we enable [outcome] for [user]?"
- **Too vague:** "Help people be healthier" (no boundaries)
  - Fix: Add specifics about who, what, and evidence
- **Scope creep:** Problem keeps expanding as team learns
  - Fix: Use Step 0 (B2) as anchor, only update if fundamentally changed

### Domain Errors
- **Too broad:** "Healthcare" instead of "Post-acute cognitive rehabilitation"
  - Fix: Add boundaries (age range, geography, condition)
- **Shifting focus:** Started B2C, now pivoting to B2B
  - Fix: Document current domain, note pivot history
- **Mismatched resources:** Attacking complex regulated domain with lightweight team
  - Fix: Lower domain score, note gap in assessment

### Team/Resource Errors
- **Overstating capability:** "World-class team" with no evidence
  - Fix: Use specific metrics (years, achievements, credentials)
- **Ignoring gaps:** Not acknowledging missing functions
  - Fix: List gaps explicitly in assessment summary
- **Claiming differentiators:** Standard experience positioned as unique
  - Fix: Mark "Differentiator? No" unless truly rare

### Character Limit Violations
- **Verbosity:** Using 300 characters when limit is 250
  - Fix: Remove filler, use abbreviations, cut adjectives
- **Over-explaining:** Trying to include everything
  - Fix: Prioritize most important information
