# Vianeo Market Maturity Assessment: Complete Workflow Guide

## Overview

This guide walks you through the complete process of conducting a Vianeo Market Maturity Assessment using the 29-question framework.

**Time Required**: 45-90 minutes (depending on information availability)
**Outcome**: Evidence-based assessment table with dimension scores and action recommendations

---

## Pre-Assessment Preparation

### Gather Materials

Collect all available information about the business:

**Essential Documents**:
- [ ] Business plan or pitch deck
- [ ] Customer research (interviews, surveys, feedback)
- [ ] Competitive analysis
- [ ] Financial projections or models
- [ ] Team information and org chart
- [ ] Product specifications or prototypes
- [ ] Market research reports

**Supporting Materials**:
- [ ] Partnership agreements or MOUs
- [ ] User testing results
- [ ] Regulatory analysis
- [ ] Ecosystem maps
- [ ] Letters of support or intent
- [ ] Patent filings or IP documentation

**If Missing Documents**: Note which materials are unavailable (you'll score these areas as 1 and specify what's needed).

---

## Step 1: Quick Scan (10 minutes)

Before detailed assessment, do a rapid scan to understand overall readiness.

### Read Through Key Documents
- Pitch deck (understand the business)
- Any customer research (gauge validation level)
- Financial model (check revenue assumptions)

### Initial Impression Checklist

**Strong Signals** (likely scores 4-5):
- [ ] 10+ customer interviews documented
- [ ] Working prototype with user testing
- [ ] Competitive analysis with direct testing
- [ ] Revenue tested with multiple customers
- [ ] Complete team with clear commitments
- [ ] Detailed ecosystem mapping

**Warning Signals** (likely scores 1-2):
- [ ] No customer interviews
- [ ] Solution in search of a problem
- [ ] No competitive analysis
- [ ] Revenue model untested
- [ ] Team gaps or low commitment
- [ ] Ecosystem not mapped

This quick scan helps you know where to focus detailed evaluation.

## Step 2: Systematic Assessment (30-60 minutes)

Work through all 29 questions systematically using the evidence checklist.

### Assessment Process

For each question:

1. **Read the question carefully**
2. **Check the Evidence Checklist** (What evidence should exist?)
3. **Search your materials** (Does evidence exist?)
4. **Determine score** (Use the 1-5 scale)
5. **Write justification** (One sentence explaining score)
6. **Document evidence** (Cite specific source or note what's missing)

### Use This Template for Each Question

```
Question #: [Q1-Q29]
Score: [1-5]
Justification: [One concise sentence]
Evidence Reference: [Specific source or "Need [what's required]"]
```

### Work by Dimension for Efficiency

**Do DESIRABILITY first** (12 questions, highest weight 25%)
- This is usually where most evidence exists
- Establishes baseline for what validation looks like

**Then FEASIBILITY** (5 questions)
- Usually straightforward based on team and resources

**Then VIABILITY** (4 questions)
- Business model questions

**Then ACCEPTABILITY** (6 questions)
- Ecosystem understanding

**Then LEGITIMACY** (2 questions)
- Foundation questions

---

## Step 3: Quality Check (10 minutes)

Before finalizing, review your assessment for consistency and accuracy.

### Consistency Checks

**Cross-Question Logic**:
- If Q7 (interviews) = 1, then Q2, Q13, Q25 should also be low
- If Q6 (competitive analysis) = 1, then Q21 should be low
- If Q22 (testing per segment) = 5, then Q9, Q12 should be ≥3

**Evidence Verification**:
- Each score 4-5 has specific external evidence cited
- Each score 1 specifies what evidence is needed
- No vague references ("team believes", "we think")

**Justification Quality**:
- One sentence only
- Specific, not generic
- Factual, not aspirational
- Clear connection to score

### Common Mistakes to Fix

**Mistake**: "Good progress on customer validation" (Score 4)
**Fix**: "Interviewed 3 customers per segment, below threshold of 5+" (Score 2)

**Mistake**: "Team is committed" (Score 5)
**Fix**: "Core team full-time but key roles unfilled" (Score 3)

**Mistake**: "Need more research" (Evidence for Score 1)
**Fix**: "Need 5+ user interviews per segment validating needs" (Specific)

---

## Step 4: Calculate Scores (5 minutes)

### Dimension Scores

Calculate average score for each dimension:

**Legitimacy** = (Q8 + Q13) / 2

**Desirability** = (Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q9 + Q11 + Q12 + Q21 + Q22 + Q25 + Q28) / 12

**Acceptability** = (Q3 + Q10 + Q17 + Q20 + Q23 + Q24) / 6

**Feasibility** = (Q1 + Q15 + Q16 + Q18 + Q26) / 5

**Viability** = (Q14 + Q19 + Q27 + Q29) / 4

### Overall Weighted Score

**Overall** = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

### Check Against Thresholds

| Dimension | Your Score | Threshold | Pass? |
|-----------|------------|-----------|-------|
| Legitimacy | ___ | 3.0 | ___ |
| Desirability | ___ | 3.5 | ___ |
| Acceptability | ___ | 3.0 | ___ |
| Feasibility | ___ | 3.0 | ___ |
| Viability | ___ | 3.0 | ___ |
| **Overall** | ___ | **3.2** | ___ |

## Step 5: Analysis and Recommendations (10-15 minutes)

### Identify Patterns

**Top 3 Strengths** (highest scoring questions or dimensions):
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

**Top 3 Critical Gaps** (lowest scoring questions, especially any score 1):
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

### Determine Category

Based on Overall Score:

| Score | Category | Your Assessment |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| 4.5-5.0 | Strong | Proceed with implementation |
| 3.5-4.4 | Promising | Proceed, strengthen gaps |
| 3.0-3.4 | Developing | Conditional proceed |
| 2.0-2.9 | Problematic | Reassess assumptions |
| <2.0 | Non-viable | Consider pivot |

**Your Category**: _______________

### Generate Action Plan

For each dimension below threshold or with critical gaps:

**Dimension**: _______________
**Current Score**: _______________
**Gap Analysis**: What's missing?
**Critical Actions**: What needs to happen?
**Timeline**: When should this be completed?
**Responsible**: Who should lead this?

### Prioritize Actions

**Immediate (Next 2 weeks)**:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

**Near-term (Next 30-60 days)**:
1. _______________
2. _______________
3. _______________

## Step 6: Documentation and Sharing (5 minutes)

### Prepare Final Report

Your assessment should include:

1. **Assessment Table** (all 29 questions with scores, justifications, evidence)
2. **Dimension Summary** (scores for each dimension)
3. **Overall Score and Category**
4. **Top Strengths** (3-5 items)
5. **Critical Gaps** (3-5 items)
6. **Recommended Actions** (prioritized list)
7. **Next Assessment Date** (when to reassess)

### Share with Stakeholders

**For Founders/Team**:
- Focus on actionable gaps
- Celebrate strengths
- Provide clear next steps
- Set timeline for follow-up

**For Investors/Partners**:
- Emphasize evidence quality
- Highlight validation progress
- Note remaining risks
- Show path to threshold scores

## Common Assessment Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Early Stage (Many Score 1s)

**Expected Pattern**:
- Low Desirability (no user validation)
- Low Viability (revenue untested)
- Maybe stronger Legitimacy (problem identified)

**What to Do**:
- Don't panic - this is normal for early stage
- Focus on critical validation next steps
- Prioritize customer interviews
- Test problem existence before building

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Conduct 10+ customer discovery interviews
2. Map competitive landscape
3. Test problem significance
4. Reassess in 30 days

---

### Scenario 2: Mid-Stage (Mix of 2s and 3s)

**Expected Pattern**:
- Some validation complete
- Gaps in testing or ecosystem understanding
- Basic business model defined

**What to Do**:
- Build on existing validation
- Address specific gaps identified
- Strengthen external validation
- Test business model assumptions

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Increase customer testing to reach thresholds
2. Complete ecosystem mapping
3. Test revenue model with 5+ customers
4. Reassess in 60 days

---

### Scenario 3: Advanced Stage (Many 4s and 5s)

**Expected Pattern**:
- Strong validation across most dimensions
- Few remaining gaps
- Ready for scale or investment

**What to Do**:
- Address any remaining scores below threshold
- Document evidence for due diligence
- Prepare for growth phase
- Monitor for market changes

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Close final validation gaps
2. Strengthen lowest dimension
3. Document complete evidence package
4. Reassess quarterly

---

## Red Flags That Require Immediate Attention

Stop and reassess immediately if you see:

**Pattern 1: No Customer Validation**
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews)
- Q13 = 1 (problem not validated)
- Q22 = 1 (not tested with customers)

**Action**: Stop building, start interviewing. Do not proceed until Desirability improves.

**Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness**
- Q3 = 1 (don't know players)
- Q17 = 1 (no resistance identified)
- Q20 = 1 (can't map market)

**Action**: Map ecosystem before investing more. May face unexpected resistance.

**Pattern 3: Business Model Untested**
- Q14 = 1 (revenue undefined)
- Q19 = 1 (not tested with customers)
- Q27 = 1 (can't articulate value)

**Action**: Define and test revenue model immediately. Great product doesn't mean sustainable business.

**Pattern 4: Resource Constraints**
- Q1 = 1 (lacking resources)
- Q16 = 1 (no committed team)
- Q26 = 1 (can't develop offer)

**Action**: Address resource gaps before proceeding. Execution impossible without fundamentals.

---

## Follow-Up Assessment Schedule

**If Overall Score < 3.0**: Reassess every 2-4 weeks until above 3.0
**If Overall Score 3.0-3.4**: Reassess every 4-6 weeks until above 3.5
**If Overall Score 3.5-4.4**: Reassess every 2-3 months
**If Overall Score 4.5+**: Reassess quarterly or after major changes

**Reassess Immediately After**:
- Major business model pivot
- Significant funding round
- New market entry
- Major competitive development
- Regulatory environment change
- Key partnership formation or loss

## Tips for Effective Assessment

### Stay Objective
- Score what exists, not what's planned
- Require evidence for high scores
- Don't inflate scores to look good
- Lower scores show where to focus effort

### Be Specific
- Cite exact evidence sources
- Use numbers when available
- Name specific documents
- Provide context for scores

### Focus on Action
- Every score 1 should specify what's needed
- Identify concrete next steps
- Set realistic timelines
- Assign responsibility

### Document Thoroughly
- Future assessments need baseline
- Investors need evidence trail
- Team needs clear direction
- Progress tracking requires starting point
