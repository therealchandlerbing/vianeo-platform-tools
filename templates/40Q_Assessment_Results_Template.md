## OVERALL NARRATIVE ASSESSMENT

### Paragraph 1: Overall Readiness

[2-3 sentences summarizing overall readiness across all four dimensions. Note strongest dimension and weakest dimension. Provide overall impression of venture maturity relative to stated stage.]

### Paragraph 2: Key Strengths Pattern

[2-3 sentences discussing the pattern of strengths. Is this a strong team with weak market validation? Strong technology with execution concerns? Technical founders needing commercial capability? What is the core foundational strength of this venture?]

### Paragraph 3: Critical Risks and Gaps

[2-3 sentences discussing the most critical risks identified through gaps, red flags, and low scores. Prioritize by impact and urgency. What could derail this venture if not addressed? Which gaps are acceptable for current stage vs. concerning?]

### Paragraph 4: Stage Appropriateness

[2-3 sentences assessing whether scores are appropriate for the venture's current stage. Early-stage ventures (Idea/Prototype) naturally have lower Management and Commercial scores. Are the gaps concerning for this specific stage or expected and acceptable? Is the venture punching above its weight in any dimension?]

### Paragraph 5: Recommendation for Next Steps

[2-3 sentences with specific recommendation. Options: (1) Proceed to Step 3 Market Maturity Assessment, (2) Request additional information before proceeding - specify what, (3) Consider non-viable if critical gaps across multiple dimensions - explain why, (4) Conditional proceed with specific milestones or evidence needed first - be specific about conditions.]
