# STEP 5: Desirability - Needs/Requesters Analysis

**Time Required:** 30-40 minutes
**Output:** FOUR documents - (1) Markdown analysis file, (2) DOCX Part 1: Core Analysis, (3) DOCX Part 2: Strategic Analysis, (4) DOCX Part 3: Interview Guide
**Weight in VIANEO Score:** 25% of overall evaluation (highest weight)

---

## Overview

The Desirability Assessment validates that specific people need your specific solution by examining:

1. **WHO** needs your solution? (Requesters - 6-10 roles)
2. **WHAT** do they need? (10 needs: Tasks, Pains, Expectations)
3. **WHY** are existing solutions insufficient? (5-6 competitive alternatives with limitations)
4. **HOW VALIDATED** are these assumptions? (Evidence requirements and gaps)

**Philosophy:** Legitimacy confirms a real problem exists. Desirability confirms specific people want YOUR solution. Without validated customer needs, even the best technology fails commercially. This framework forces honest assessment of market validation before significant capital investment.

---

## Why Desirability Matters (25% Weight)

Many innovative projects fail not because the technology doesn't work, but because:
- They built for hypothetical users, not validated needs
- They assumed pain intensity without customer validation
- They underestimated satisfaction with existing solutions
- They overestimated willingness to pay or change behavior

**This framework prevents that failure.** By forcing honest assessment of validation status and explicit identification of assumptions, it shows you where market risk lies *before* you invest significant capital.

## MARKDOWN ANALYSIS FILE - COMPLETE STRUCTURE

### Section 1: INPUTS USED

Document what inputs informed this analysis. **Be ruthlessly honest about validation status.**

**Required Fields:**
- **Problem Statement** (from Legitimacy assessment)
- **Field of Application** (from Legitimacy assessment)
- **Business Model Canvas** (status: complete/draft/not yet created)
- **Interview/Research Data Status** (be specific about quantity and quality)

**Example (Strong):**
```markdown
**Interview/Research Data Status:**
23 customer discovery interviews completed across 5 segments (8 research labs,
7 manufacturers, 5 strategic sector buyers, 3 3D printing providers). Average
interview length 52 minutes. Transcripts available. Market sizing from USGS
Rare Earth Elements report (2024) and Brazil trade statistics (MDIC 2023-2024).
```

**Example (Weak but Honest):**
```markdown
**Interview/Research Data Status:**
No direct customer interviews conducted. Analysis based on secondary research,
market analysis, and team's institutional knowledge. All requesters require
validation through primary research.
```

**Critical:** If you have NO direct customer interviews, say so explicitly. Don't hide it.

---

### Section 2: REQUESTERS TABLE (6-10 roles)

**Purpose:** Identify who needs your solution and how well you understand them.

**Structure:** Table with three columns

| Requester Role | Description | Reliability |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|

**Column 1: Requester Role (3-6 words)**
- Be specific: "Adult children managing early dementia for aging parents" NOT "caregivers"
- Use professional titles: "Permanent Magnet Manufacturers" NOT "magnet people"
- Distinguish users from buyers when different
- Examples:
  - "Research Labs & Universities"
  - "Permanent Magnet Manufacturers"
  - "Strategic Sector Manufacturers (Defense/Wind/EV)"
  - "Clinical Staff (Hospital Users)"
  - "Hospital Facilities Administrators (Buyers)"

**Column 2: Description (2-4 sentences)**

Strong descriptions include:
1. **Who they are** (role, context, scale)
2. **Why they matter** (their relationship to your solution)
3. **Current situation** (what they do now, constraints they face)
4. **Specific details** (company size, sector, geography if relevant)

**Poor Description Example:**
"People who need magnets for various industrial uses."

**Strong Description Example:**
"Companies producing finished NdFeB magnets for industrial applications. Currently import raw powders from China/Japan. Serve as critical intermediary between raw materials and end-use sectors. Scale: small to medium Brazilian manufacturers facing supply chain vulnerability."

**Column 3: Reliability Rating**

Use the four-tier system exactly:
- **"More than 5 interviewed"** - Strong evidence base
- **"Less than 5 interviewed [validate with interviews]"** - Preliminary validation
- **Not yet interviewed [validate with interviews]"** - Hypothesis only
- **"Unspecified [validate with interviews]"** - No data available

**Critical Rule:** Be honest. A table showing "Not yet interviewed" for every requester is valuable because it identifies what you need to do. Fabricating validation creates false confidence.

**Quality Standards:**
- Each requester must be distinct with different needs or context
- Descriptions must be specific, not generic
- Reliability ratings must be honest and evidence-based
- Users vs. buyers distinction must be clear where applicable

---

### Section 3: NEEDS ANALYSIS (10 needs total)

**Purpose:** Document what requesters need to accomplish, eliminate, or achieve.

**Framework: Tasks / Pains / Expectations**

**TASKS** (3-4 needs) = Jobs to be done
- What activities are they trying to complete?
- What goals are they working toward?
- What must they accomplish in their role?

**PAINS** (3-4 needs) = Problems to eliminate
- What frustrates them?
- What risks keep them up at night?
- What obstacles block their progress?

**EXPECTATIONS** (3-4 needs) = Desired outcomes
- What does success look like?
- What state do they want to reach?
- What gives them confidence or satisfaction?

**CRITICAL CHARACTER LIMIT: 60 CHARACTERS MAXIMUM PER NEED**

This is non-negotiable. It forces clarity and prevents rambling.

**Techniques for staying under 60 characters:**
- Start with strong verb: "Maintain" not "Need to maintain"
- Cut adjectives: "Track performance" not "Track cognitive performance changes"
- Remove filler: "Access tools" not "Access affordable clinical-grade assessment tools"
- Use abbreviations if universal: "NdFeB" not "Neodymium-Iron-Boron"

**Character count examples:**
```
57 chars: "Access cost-competitive domestic raw materials"
59 chars: "Eliminate dependency on Chinese/Japanese imports"
60 chars: "Enable 3D printing applications with spherical powders"
```

**Quality Standards:**

1. **Each need must be distinct** - Test: "Could I satisfy one need without satisfying another?"

```
❌ Overlapping needs:
• "Maintain cognitive health"
• "Keep brain sharp"
• "Prevent decline"
(These are the same need)

✅ Distinct needs:
• "Track cognitive performance objectively" (measurement)
• "Practice evidence-based brain training" (intervention)
• "Identify early decline signs" (detection)
(These are different needs addressable by different solutions)
```

2. **No embedded solutions**

```
❌ "Need mobile app to track brain health"
(This embeds solution - mobile app - in the need statement)

✅ "Track cognitive performance objectively"
(This is the actual need. Mobile app is one possible solution)
```

3. **Evidence-based or explicitly hypothesized**

If validated through interviews:
"Eliminate dependency on Chinese/Japanese imports"
*(Heard from 12/15 magnet manufacturers interviewed)*

If hypothesis:
"Enable 3D printing applications with spherical powders"
*[requires validation: only 2/15 manufacturers mentioned 3D printing interest]*

**Distribution Target:**
- Tasks: 3-4 needs
- Pains: 3-4 needs
- Expectations: 3-4 needs

---

### Section 4: EXISTING SOLUTIONS (5-6 alternatives)

**Purpose:** Map competitive landscape and identify gaps

**Structure:** Table with three columns

| Solution | Description | Limitations Identified |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|

**Column 1: Solution Name/Type**
- Be specific: "Lumosity" not "brain training apps"
- Use actual brand names when possible
- Generic categories when needed: "Conventional High-Temperature Production"
- **Always include:** "Doing Nothing" or "Status Quo" as final entry

**Column 2: Description (2-3 sentences)**

Include:
1. What it is (product, service, process, workaround)
2. Who uses it (market share, user base, geography)
3. How it works (key features, approach, mechanism)

**Strong description example:**
"Established global suppliers (primarily China) providing dense NdFeB alloy powders to Brazilian manufacturers. Dominant market solution with mature supply chains and competitive pricing due to economies of scale."

**Column 3: Limitations Identified (2-4 sentences)**

This is the most important column. It shows **why your opportunity exists**.

**Critical:** Limitations must be:
- Specific (not vague)
- Evidence-based (from user research or testing)
- Meaningful (not trivial complaints)
- Connected to needs (explains unmet needs from Section 3)

**Poor limitations example:**
"Not very good. Users seem unhappy. Could be better."

**Strong limitations example:**
"Trade barriers intensifying due to geopolitical tensions. No customization for Brazilian specifications. Supply chain vulnerable to export controls. Prices subject to international market volatility. No circular economy/recycling integration."

**The "Doing Nothing" Row**

Always include this. Status quo is a real competitor.

**Example:**
| Doing Nothing (Import Dependency Status Quo) | Organizations continue relying entirely on imported NdFeB powders and finished magnets. Current state for majority of Brazilian manufacturers and institutions. Inaction remains a choice. | Strategic vulnerability to trade disruptions. No control over specifications or pricing. Technology dependence on foreign suppliers. Incompatible with Brazil's strategic sovereignty goals. Limits domestic innovation in magnet applications. |

**Why this matters:** If you can't articulate why "doing nothing" is problematic, you don't have a compelling value proposition.

---

### Section 5: EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS & VALIDATION STATUS

**Purpose:** Explicitly separate what you know from what you assume

**Structure:**

#### Current Evidence Base

**Strong Evidence (from project materials):**
List facts you can cite with sources. Examples:
- "Global supermagnets market size: >$15 billion annually (source: USGS 2024)"
- "Brazil imports 100% of rare earth elements (source: MDIC trade data 2023-2024)"
- "TRL 4 achieved with validated lab results (source: CDTN technical report Nov 2025)"

**Weak Evidence (assumptions requiring validation):**
List assumptions that seem logical but lack customer validation. Examples:
- "Customer willingness to pay premium for domestic supply"
- "3D printing demand among Brazilian magnet producers"
- "Preference for customization vs. standardized products"

#### Critical Validation Gaps

Prioritize assumptions by urgency and impact:

**High Priority [requires customer interviews]:** (1-5 questions)
Questions that directly affect business model viability
- Example: "Do manufacturers experience significant pain from import dependence?"
- Example: "What price premium would they pay for domestic supply?"

**Medium Priority [requires market research]:** (6-10 questions)
Questions answerable through secondary research
- Example: "What's the addressable market size for Brazil specifically?"
- Example: "What certifications are required?"

**Low Priority [can be refined later]:** (11-12 questions)
Nice-to-know details that don't affect go/no-go decisions
- Example: "Detailed decision-making processes for each segment"

---

### Section 6: REQUESTERS RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

Synthesize overall validation status. **Be brutally honest about confidence level.**

**Strong assessment example:**
"Current Reliability: Mixed across segments. Research labs (5 interviewed) and manufacturers (7 interviewed) show preliminary validation. Strategic sectors (defense, wind, EV) remain hypothetical with zero direct validation. Overall confidence: moderate for R&D market, weak for commercial market."

**Weak assessment that's honest (and therefore valuable):**
"Current Reliability Across All Requesters: 'Not yet interviewed'. This project demonstrates strong technical legitimacy but weak commercial validation. All needs analysis represents hypotheses rather than validated insights. Next critical step: conduct 20-30 customer discovery interviews."

Address:
- What has been validated vs. hypothesized
- Technical vs. commercial validation status
- Implications for business model confidence
- Required next steps

---

### Section 7: INTEGRATION WITH BUSINESS MODEL

Connect requesters to revenue streams. Identify alignment and misalignment.

#### Revenue Model Implications

List revenue streams from business model, then assess:
- Which requester segments align with each revenue stream
- Where misalignment risks exist
- Whether assumptions about willingness to pay are validated

**Example:**
```markdown
**Revenue Stream:** Technology transfer/licensing
**Best Fit:** Industrial Research Centers, Permanent Magnet Manufacturers
**Misalignment Risk:** Assumes customers want to produce in-house (capital intensive)
vs. purchase finished powders (operationally simpler). Requires validation.
```

#### Go-to-Market Priority Recommendation

Suggest phased approach with timeline, target, goal, and metrics:

**Phase 1** (Months 1-6): Pilot with Research Labs
- **Target:** 3-5 university/government research institutions
- **Goal:** Validate technical specifications and customization needs
- **Metrics:** 2+ pilot agreements, 80%+ satisfaction with powder characteristics

**Phase 2** (Months 7-12): Early Commercial Adoption
- **Target:** 2-3 small-medium magnet manufacturers
- **Goal:** Validate commercial viability and pricing model
- **Metrics:** $100K+ in revenue, 60%+ gross margins, reorder rate >50%

**Phase 3** (Months 13-24): Strategic Sector Expansion
- **Target:** Defense, wind energy, EV manufacturers
- **Goal:** Scale production and prove strategic value proposition
- **Metrics:** 5+ strategic customers, $1M+ revenue, regulatory approvals

---

### Section 8: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING INSIGHTS

#### Differentiation Strength Assessment

**Strong Differentiators (validated):**
List competitive advantages with evidence:
- "Spherical morphology enabling 3D printing (validated in 5+ lab tests)"
- "Customizable powder specifications (confirmed by 8/10 research labs as critical need)"

**Uncertain Differentiators (require validation):**
List claims requiring market validation:
- "Faster delivery times due to domestic production (not yet tested with customers)"
- "Lower switching costs (assumption, not validated)"

**Missing Differentiation:**
Gaps where competitors have advantages you don't:
- "Established supply chains and proven reliability (Chinese suppliers)"
- "Economies of scale enabling lower pricing (large manufacturers)"

---

### Section 9: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION

Three priorities with timeline, objective, and success metrics. Make these **specific and actionable**.

#### Priority 1: [Action Name] (Timeline)

**Objective:** Clear statement of what you're trying to learn or achieve

**Success Metrics:**
- Measurable outcome 1
- Measurable outcome 2
- Measurable outcome 3

**Example:**

#### Priority 1: Customer Discovery Campaign (Weeks 1-12)

**Objective:** Validate requester hypotheses and needs assumptions across all segments

**Success Metrics:**
- 20+ completed interviews (67% completion rate)
- 3+ pilot material testing agreements
- Clear ranking of needs by importance across segments
- Validated pricing range for each segment
- Identification of 2-3 early adopter customers

---

### Section 10: EVIDENCE-BASED VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Comprehensive checklist covering all validation needs:

**Requesters Validation:**
- [ ] 5+ interviews per primary requester segment
- [ ] Users vs. buyers distinction clarified for B2B segments
- [ ] Decision-making authority identified
- [ ] Budget/purchasing power confirmed
- [ ] Timeline for purchase decisions understood

**Needs Validation:**
- [ ] All 10 needs tested with customers (not just assumed)
- [ ] Needs ranked by importance across segments
- [ ] Pain intensity quantified (cost, time, risk)
- [ ] Current workarounds documented
- [ ] Willingness to switch validated

**Existing Solutions Validation:**
- [ ] All major competitors tested or researched
- [ ] Customer satisfaction with alternatives assessed
- [ ] Switching costs quantified
- [ ] Non-obvious substitutes identified
- [ ] "Doing nothing" appeal honestly evaluated

**Business Model Alignment:**
- [ ] Revenue streams tested with target customers
- [ ] Pricing validated (not just guessed)
- [ ] Go-to-market sequence prioritized by evidence
- [ ] Channel preferences confirmed
- [ ] Partnership requirements validated

---

### Section 11: CONCLUSION - PATH FORWARD

#### Current Situation

**Legitimacy:** [Score/Assessment from Step 4]
**Desirability:** [Honest assessment based on validation level]

**Example:**
"Legitimacy: 4.2/5 (Above Average) - Strong technical foundation and clear problem definition.
Desirability: 2.5/5 (Below Average) - Weak commercial validation. Technical capabilities strong but market needs largely unvalidated."

#### The Disconnect (if applicable)

Explain gap between technical capability and market validation.

**Example:**
"This project exhibits a common pattern: exceptional technical legitimacy (advanced materials science, proven lab results, strong team) but insufficient market validation. The technology works, but we don't yet know if anyone will buy it at a price that makes business sense."

#### Strategic Recommendation

**Do Not Proceed to [Next Major Investment] Until:**
1. Complete 20+ customer discovery interviews
2. Secure 3+ pilot testing agreements with paying customers
3. Validate willingness to pay premium vs. import pricing
4. Confirm technical specifications match commercial requirements
5. Identify 2-3 early adopter customers ready to commit

**Consider [Alternative Approach]:**
- Start with research/academic market (lower sales friction, higher margin tolerance)
- Partner with established distributor to access customer relationships
- Conduct paid pilot program to validate willingness to pay before scaling production

#### Bottom Line

**Technology Risk:** [Low/Medium/High with justification]
**Market Risk:** [Low/Medium/High with justification]

**Recommendation:** [Clear next step]

**Example:**
"Technology Risk: Low (TRL 4, validated in lab, clear technical roadmap)
Market Risk: High (no customer interviews, untested pricing, unvalidated demand)

**Recommendation:** PAUSE further technical development. Invest next 12 weeks in intensive customer discovery (20-30 interviews). Do not proceed with production scale-up until commercial validation strengthens to ≥3.5/5."

### Section 12: APPENDIX - CUSTOMER DISCOVERY INTERVIEW GUIDE

#### Interview Structure (45-60 minutes)

**Phase 1: Opening (5 minutes)**
- Introduce yourself and purpose: "We're researching [domain] to understand challenges and needs"
- Set expectations: "This is research, not a sales pitch. We want to learn from your experience"
- Get permission to take notes or record
- Build rapport with warm-up question: "Tell me about your role and what you're working on"

**Phase 2: Current State (15 minutes)**

Explore their current situation and practices:
1. "Walk me through how you currently [do the relevant task]"
2. "What tools or solutions are you using today?"
3. "How did you choose those solutions?"
4. "What's working well with your current approach?"
5. "What would you change if you could?"

**Phase 3: Problem Validation (15 minutes)**

Validate the problems and pain points:
1. "Tell me about a time when [problem] caused issues for you"
2. "How often does this problem occur?"
3. "What does this problem cost you?" (time, money, opportunity, reputation)
4. "What have you tried to solve this?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"

**Phase 4: Pricing & Willingness to Pay (10 minutes)**

Understand financial constraints and decision factors:
1. "What's your budget for [category of solution]?"
2. "How do you make purchasing decisions for tools like this?"
3. "If a solution saved you [quantified benefit], what would that be worth?"
4. "What would make a solution too expensive to consider?"

**Phase 5: Solution Validation (10 minutes)**

Introduce technology AFTER understanding their needs:
1. "We're exploring a solution that [brief description]. How does that sound?"
2. "Which of the problems we discussed would this address for you?"
3. "What concerns do you have about this approach?"
4. "If this were available today at $X, would you try it?"
5. "What would need to be true for you to switch from your current solution?"

**Phase 6: Close (5 minutes)**

Next steps and relationship building:
1. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
2. "Would you be interested in testing an early version?"
3. "Can I follow up with you in [timeframe]?"

#### Key Insights to Capture

Document these critical data points:
- **Pain Intensity:** How much does the problem cost them? (quantify)
- **Current Solutions:** What do they use now? Satisfaction level?
- **Decision Criteria:** What factors matter most? Who decides?
- **Willingness to Pay:** Specific price points, not just "interested"
- **Objections:** Why might they NOT buy?
- **Technical Requirements:** What exactly matters? (specs, integration, support)
- **Timeline:** When do they make decisions? What's urgent vs. nice-to-have?
- **Alternatives Considered:** What else have they tried/considered?

#### Interview Best Practices

1. **Listen More, Talk Less (80/20 rule)**
   - You should listen 80% of the time, talk 20%
   - Resist urge to pitch or explain
   - Comfortable silence = they're thinking (don't fill it)

2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
   - "Tell me about..." not "Do you...?"
   - "How" and "Why" questions encourage stories
   - Avoid yes/no questions

3. **Dig Deeper with Follow-Ups**
   - "Why is that?"
   - "Tell me more"
   - "Can you give me an example?"
   - "What else?"

4. **Listen for Problems, Not Solutions**
   - Don't pitch your solution early
   - Understand their needs first
   - They'll often propose solutions (note it, but dig for underlying need)

5. **Validate with Specifics**
   - "That's interesting" ≠ validation
   - Get concrete: "How much would you pay?"
   - Ask for commitment: "Would you test this?"

6. **Don't Sell, Learn**
   - Frame as research, not sales
   - You're there to understand, not convince
   - Their honesty is more valuable than their politeness

7. **End with Referrals**
   - Always ask: "Who else should I talk to?"
   - Warm introductions >> cold outreach
   - Build network systematically

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Leading questions:** "Wouldn't it be great if...?" (plants ideas)
- **Pitching too early:** Wait until Phase 5 to introduce your solution
- **Taking "nice" responses at face value:** "That sounds interesting" ≠ validation
- **Ignoring negative signals:** Dissatisfaction with status quo is valuable data
- **Not documenting immediately:** Write notes right after while fresh
- **Confirmation bias:** Hear what they actually say, not what you want to hear
- **Skipping pricing questions:** "Would you pay for this?" is critical validation
- **Talking more than listening:** If you're explaining, you're not learning

#### Target Interview Segments

**Distribution Target:**
- 10 [Primary Requester Segment 1]
- 10 [Primary Requester Segment 2]
- 10 [Primary Requester Segment 3]

**Success Target:** 20+ completed interviews (67% completion rate)

**Why target more than you need?**
- Some interviews won't materialize (no-shows, cancellations)
- Some will be low-quality (wrong person, short duration, guarded responses)
- You need enough data to see patterns, not just anecdotes

**Interview Completion Timeline:** 8-12 weeks recommended

✅ Better: "Hospital facilities administrators (buyers)", "Clinical staff (users)"
```

---

### Phase 4: Extract Needs (15 minutes)

Complete Section 3: NEEDS ANALYSIS

1. **Brainstorm 15-20 candidate needs** from:
   - Customer interview transcripts
   - User research notes
   - Problem statement
   - Competitive gaps
   - Team domain knowledge

2. **Categorize into Tasks/Pains/Expectations**
   - Tasks: What they're trying to accomplish

   - Expectations: Outcomes they desire

3. **Refine to 10 best needs (3-4 in each category)**
   - Remove duplicates
   - Remove solution-embedded needs
   - Ensure each is distinct

4. **Edit to ≤60 characters each**
   - Use character counter
   - Cut filler words
   - Use strong verbs

   - Direct competitors (specific names)
   - Indirect competitors (different approach, same outcome)
   - Non-obvious substitutes
   - **Always include: "Doing Nothing"**

2. For each solution:
   - **Description:** What it is, who uses it, how it works (2-3 sentences)
   - **Limitations:** Why it falls short, specific gaps, evidence-based (2-4 sentences)

3. Test your limitations:
   - Are they specific? (not "not very good")
   - Are they evidence-based? (from research/testing, not assumption)
   - Are they meaningful? (not trivial complaints)
   - Do they connect to needs? (explain why needs are unmet)

**Quality Check:**
- [ ] All major competitors included
- [ ] Non-obvious substitutes identified
- [ ] "Doing nothing" included with honest assessment
- [ ] Limitations are specific and evidence-based

---

## Integration with VIANEO Framework

**Links from Previous Steps:**

**From Step 4 (Legitimacy):**
- Problem Statement → Informs requesters and needs
- Field of Application → Defines requester scope
- Team & Approach → Validation capability assessment

**From Step 3 (29Q Market Maturity):**
- Desirability dimension scores → Baseline assessment
- Q7 (customer interviews) → Validation status
- Q13 (problem validation) → Evidence of need

**From Step 0 (Executive Brief):**
- B4 (Target Market) → Requester segments
- B6 (Traction) → Validation evidence

**Feeds into Overall VIANEO Score:**
- Desirability Weight: 25% (highest weight)
- If Desirability < 3.5, this is a red flag for overall evaluation
- Desirability gaps inform Acceptability, Feasibility, Viability focus areas

**Feeds Step 6 (Needs Qualification Matrix):**
- Requesters become matrix columns
- Needs become matrix rows
- Validation status informs confidence ratings

**Feeds Step 7 (Ecosystem Mapping):**
- Requesters become ecosystem players
- Needs inform value propositions
- Existing solutions inform competitive dynamics

## Common Pitfalls

### Requesters Errors

**Pitfall 1:** Generic or overlapping requesters
```
❌ Poor: "Small businesses", "Medium businesses", "Large businesses"
✅ Better: Distinct by needs, not size
```

**Pitfall 2:** Confusing users with buyers
```
❌ Poor: Single requester "Hospital administrators"
✅ Better: "Hospital facilities administrators (buyers)" + "Clinical staff (users)"
```

**Pitfall 3:** Treating hypotheses as validated
```
❌ Poor: "Less than 5 interviewed" (when you interviewed zero)
✅ Better: "Not yet interviewed [validate with interviews]"
```

### Needs Errors

**Pitfall 1:** Over 60 characters
```
❌ Poor: "Access affordable and reliable clinical-grade cognitive assessment tools" (76 chars)
✅ Better: "Access clinical-grade cognitive assessment tools" (48 chars)
```

**Pitfall 2:** Embedding solutions
```
❌ Poor: "Need mobile app to track brain health"
✅ Better: "Track cognitive performance objectively"
```

**Pitfall 3:** Overlapping needs
```
❌ Poor: "Maintain cognitive health", "Keep brain sharp", "Prevent decline"
✅ Better: Choose one, make others more distinct
```

### Solutions Errors

**Pitfall 1:** Superficial research
```
❌ Poor: "We looked at their website and it seems outdated"
✅ Better: "Interviewed 8 users. 6/8 cited limited customization as key issue"
```

**Pitfall 2:** Missing non-obvious competitors
- Direct: Brain training apps
- Indirect: Meditation apps
- Substitute: Physical exercise
- None: Doing nothing
Map all of these.

**Pitfall 3:** Assuming dissatisfaction
```
❌ Assumption: "Users must hate relying on imports"
✅ Validation: "8/15 manufacturers said import dependency is concerning but
    current pricing makes switching risky"
```

## Tips for Accurate Analysis

1. **Default skeptical:** Without customer interviews, mark "Not yet interviewed"
2. **Look for patterns:** 5+ interviews = patterns emerge, <5 = anecdotes
3. **Be honest about gaps:** Low validation is a valuable signal (tells you what to do)
4. **Distinguish users from buyers:** In B2B, these are often different people
5. **Evidence over aspirations:** "Interviewed 12 customers" not "Will validate soon"
6. **Test needs distinctness:** Could you satisfy one without the other?
7. **Challenge "doing nothing":** If status quo isn't painful, you don't have opportunity
