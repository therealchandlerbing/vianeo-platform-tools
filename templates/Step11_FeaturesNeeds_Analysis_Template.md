## Strategic Recommendations

### Priority Development (Immediate)

**1. [Feature to Build]**
- **Addresses:** [Gap need(s)]
- **Priority:** Critical - required for [market entry / core value proposition]
- **Estimated effort:** [Sprints/weeks]
- **Dependencies:** [Any technical or partner dependencies]

**2. [Feature to Build]**
- **Addresses:** [Gap need(s)]
- **Priority:** High - strengthens [competitive position / expected functionality]
- **Estimated effort:** [Sprints/weeks]
- **Dependencies:** [Any technical or partner dependencies]

### Feature Optimization

**1. [Feature to Simplify or Refocus]**
- **Current state:** [Addresses X needs, mostly low-opportunity]
- **Issue:** [Over-engineered / resource-intensive / not aligned with priorities]
- **Recommendation:** [Simplify scope / defer enhancements / consolidate with another feature]

**2. [Feature to Defer]**
- **Current coverage:** [Only addresses accessory/low-opportunity needs]
- **Recommendation:** Post-launch enhancement based on user demand
- **Resource reallocation:** [Where to redirect effort]

### Partnership Opportunities

**Needs Better Served by Partners:**
- **[Need Name]:** Consider [partner type] rather than building in-house
  - Rationale: [Speed to market, resource constraints, domain expertise needed]
  - Potential partners: [Categories or specific names if known]

## MVP Definition

### Must-Have Features (Launch Requirements)

**For High-Opportunity Needs:**
| Feature | Needs Addressed | Coverage |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| [Feature 1] | [Need A, Need B] | Critical |
| [Feature 2] | [Need C] | Critical |
| [Feature 3] | [Need D, Need E] | Critical |

**For Expected Needs (Table Stakes):**
| Feature | Needs Addressed | Coverage |
|---------|-----------------|----------|
| [Feature X] | [Expected Need 1] | Required |
| [Feature Y] | [Expected Need 2, 3] | Required |

**Total MVP Feature Set:** [X features]

### Defer to Post-Launch

| Feature | Needs Addressed | Rationale | Phase |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| [Feature A] | [Accessory only] | Not essential for core value | v2.0 |
| [Feature B] | [Low Opportunity] | User demand should validate | v2.0 |
| [Feature C] | [Medium] | Resource constraints | v2.0+ |

### Development Priorities

**Phase 1 (MVP):**
1. [Feature] - [Timeline]
2. [Feature] - [Timeline]
3. [Feature] - [Timeline]

**Phase 2 (Enhancement):**
1. [Feature] - Based on [usage data / user feedback / market validation]
2. [Feature] - If [partnership / funding / team capacity] allows

## Appendix

### Coverage Calculation Details

```
Overall Coverage = (Total Checkmarks) / (Features × Needs) × 100
                 = [X] / ([Features] × 10) × 100
                 = [XX%]

High Opportunity Coverage = (High needs with ≥1 feature) / (Total high needs)
                          = [X] / [Y]
                          = [X/Y] or [XX%]
```

### Feature-Need Matrix Summary

[Insert simplified text version of matrix for reference]

### Methodology Notes

- Checkmarks indicate direct feature-need alignment
- Conservative marking (only clear, defensible connections)
- Needs sourced from Step 7 Needs Qualification Matrix
- Features aligned with Step 4 solution description
