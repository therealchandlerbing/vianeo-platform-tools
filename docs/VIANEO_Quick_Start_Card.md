## The 1-5 Scoring Scale

| Score | Meaning | Evidence Level |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **5** | Exceptional | 15-20+ external validations, multiple sources |
| **4** | Strong | 10-15 external validations, clear evidence |
| **3** | Adequate | 5-10 external validations (minimum threshold) |
| **2** | Weak | 1-4 validations, mostly assumptions |
| **1** | Insufficient | No external validation, pure assumption |

**Key Rule**: Score what EXISTS, not what's PLANNED

## Dimension Formulas

**Legitimacy** = (Q8 + Q13) / 2

**Desirability** = (Q2 + Q4 + Q5 + Q6 + Q7 + Q9 + Q11 + Q12 + Q21 + Q22 + Q25 + Q28) / 12

**Acceptability** = (Q3 + Q10 + Q17 + Q20 + Q23 + Q24) / 6

**Feasibility** = (Q1 + Q15 + Q16 + Q18 + Q26) / 5

**Viability** = (Q14 + Q19 + Q27 + Q29) / 4

**Overall** = (Legitimacy × 0.15) + (Desirability × 0.25) + (Acceptability × 0.20) + (Feasibility × 0.20) + (Viability × 0.20)

## Dimension Thresholds

## Overall Score Categories

| Score Range | Category | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------|----------------|
| 4.5 - 5.0 | **Strong** | Proceed with implementation |
| 3.5 - 4.4 | **Promising** | Proceed, strengthen gaps |
| 3.0 - 3.4 | **Developing** | Conditional proceed |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | **Problematic** | Reassess assumptions |
| < 2.0 | **Non-viable** | Consider pivot |

## Critical Red Flags

**STOP if you see these patterns:**

### 🚨 Pattern 1: No Customer Validation
- Q7 = 1 (no interviews)
- Q13 = 1 (problem not validated)
- Q22 = 1 (not tested with customers)

**Action**: STOP building, START interviewing

### 🚨 Pattern 2: Ecosystem Blindness
- Q3 = 1 (no ecosystem map)
- Q17 = 1 (no resistance identified)
- Q20 = 1 (can't map market)

**Action**: Map ecosystem before proceeding

### 🚨 Pattern 3: Business Model Untested
- Q14 = 1 (revenue undefined)
- Q19 = 1 (not tested with customers)
- Q27 = 1 (can't articulate value)

**Action**: Define and test revenue model immediately

### 🚨 Pattern 4: Resource Constraints
- Q1 = 1 (lacking resources)
- Q16 = 1 (no committed team)
- Q26 = 1 (can't develop offer)

**Action**: Secure resources before proceeding

## Evidence Requirements

### High-Quality Evidence (Score 4-5):
- ✅ Documented customer interviews (names, dates)
- ✅ User testing results with specific feedback
- ✅ Named experts providing validation
- ✅ Cited market research reports
- ✅ Financial testing with real customers
- ✅ Signed agreements or MOUs
- ✅ Actual usage data/metrics

### Low-Quality Evidence (Score 1-2):
- ❌ "Team believes"
- ❌ "We think"
- ❌ "Planning to"
- ❌ Internal opinions only
- ❌ Assumptions
- ❌ No external validation

---

## Justification Format

**Each justification must be:**
- ✅ One sentence only
- ✅ Specific and factual
- ✅ Uses numbers when available
- ✅ Cites evidence source OR specifies what's needed

**Examples:**

**Good Justification (Score 4)**:
- "15 customer interviews per segment documented in Research Report, clear problem validation patterns"

**Good Justification (Score 1)**:
- "Need: Conduct 5-10 customer discovery interviews per segment to validate needs"

**Bad Justification**:
- "Team has good understanding of customer needs" (vague, internal)
- "Customer validation is in progress" (not scored on plans)

---

## Assessment Output Format

| Q# | Score | Justification | Evidence Reference |
|----|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| Q1 | X | [One specific sentence] | [Source or "Need: X"] |
| Q2 | X | [One specific sentence] | [Source or "Need: X"] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

---

## Consistency Rules

**If these are true, then these must follow:**

- Q7 = 1 (no interviews) → Q2, Q13, Q25 must be ≤ 2
- Q6 = 1 (no competitive analysis) → Q21 must be ≤ 2
- Q22 = 5 (extensive segment testing) → Q9, Q12 must be ≥ 3
- Q16 = 1 (no team) → Q18, Q26 must be ≤ 2

---

## Reassessment Schedule

| Overall Score | Reassess Every |
|---------------|----------------|
| < 2.0 | 2-4 weeks |
| 2.0 - 2.9 | 4 weeks |
| 3.0 - 3.4 | 4-6 weeks |
| 3.5 - 4.4 | 2-3 months |

## Quick Tips

1. **Start with Desirability** - Usually has most evidence
2. **Score conservatively** - Better to underestimate and improve
3. **Be specific** - Use numbers, names, dates
4. **External only** - Internal beliefs don't count for Score 3+
5. **One sentence** - Keep justifications concise
6. **Cite sources** - Name the document, interview, or data
7. **Specify needs** - For Score 1, say exactly what's required
8. **Check consistency** - Related questions should align
9. **Identify patterns** - Multiple Score 1s = systemic issue
10. **Focus on action** - Use results to drive improvement
