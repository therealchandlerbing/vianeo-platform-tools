- [ ] Non-obvious substitutes identified (different approaches to same outcome)
- [ ] "Doing nothing" status quo included with honest assessment
- [ ] Limitations are specific and evidence-based (not generic "not very good")
- [ ] Competitive advantages are honest, not exaggerated

## Section 5: EVIDENCE REQUIREMENTS & VALIDATION STATUS

### Current Evidence Base

**Strong Evidence (from project materials):**
- [Evidence item 1 with source citation - e.g., "Global market size: $X billion (source: Report Name 2024)"]
- [Evidence item 2 with source citation]
- [Evidence item 3 with source citation]
- [Evidence item 4 with source citation]
- [Evidence item 5 with source citation]

**Weak Evidence (assumptions requiring validation):**
- [Assumption 1 that seems logical but lacks customer validation]
- [Assumption 2 that seems logical but lacks customer validation]
- [Assumption 3 that seems logical but lacks customer validation]
- [Assumption 4 that seems logical but lacks customer validation]
- [Assumption 5 that seems logical but lacks customer validation]

### Critical Validation Gaps

**High Priority [requires customer interviews]:**
1. [Question directly affecting business model viability - e.g., willingness to pay premium]
2. [Question directly affecting business model viability - e.g., pain intensity quantification]
3. [Question directly affecting business model viability - e.g., decision criteria and timeline]
4. [Question directly affecting business model viability]
5. [Question directly affecting business model viability]

**Medium Priority [requires market research]:**
6. [Question answerable through secondary research - e.g., market size estimation]
7. [Question answerable through secondary research - e.g., certification requirements]
8. [Question answerable through secondary research]
9. [Question answerable through secondary research]
10. [Question answerable through secondary research]

**Low Priority [can be refined later]:**
11. [Nice-to-know detail that doesn't affect go/no-go - e.g., detailed decision processes]
12. [Nice-to-know detail that doesn't affect go/no-go]

## Section 6: REQUESTERS RELIABILITY ASSESSMENT

**Current Reliability Across All Requesters:** [Summary statement - be honest]

[2-3 paragraphs addressing:]
- What has been validated vs. hypothesized
- Technical vs. commercial validation status (distinguish between lab validation and customer validation)
- Implications for business model confidence
- Required next steps

**Example (Strong Validation):**
"Current Reliability: Mixed across segments. Research labs (5 interviewed) and manufacturers (7 interviewed) show preliminary validation. Strategic sectors (defense, wind, EV) remain hypothetical with zero direct validation. Overall confidence: moderate for R&D market, weak for commercial market. Immediate next step: 15 additional interviews focusing on commercial segments."

**Example (Honest Weak Validation):**
"Current Reliability Across All Requesters: 'Not yet interviewed'. This project demonstrates strong technical legitimacy (TRL 4, proven lab results) but weak commercial validation. All needs analysis represents hypotheses rather than validated insights. Technology works, but market needs are unproven. Next critical step: conduct 20-30 customer discovery interviews before any production scale-up."

## Section 11: CONCLUSION - PATH FORWARD

### Current Situation

**Legitimacy:** [Score/Assessment from Step 4 - e.g., "4.2/5 (Above Average)"]
- [1 sentence summary of legitimacy strengths]

**Desirability:** [Honest assessment based on validation level - e.g., "2.5/5 (Below Average)"]
- [1 sentence summary of desirability status]

### The Disconnect (if applicable)

[2-3 paragraphs explaining gap between technical capability and market validation, if one exists]

**Example:**
"This project exhibits a common pattern: exceptional technical legitimacy (advanced materials science, proven lab results, TRL 4, strong team) but insufficient market validation. The technology works - spherical NdFeB powders can be produced at lab scale with desired characteristics. However, we don't yet know if customers will buy it at a price that makes business sense. The team has deep technical expertise but limited commercial validation."

### Strategic Recommendation

**Do Not Proceed to [Next Major Investment] Until:**
1. [Critical gate 1 - e.g., "Complete 20+ customer discovery interviews across all requester segments"]
2. [Critical gate 2 - e.g., "Secure 3+ pilot testing agreements with paying customers"]
3. [Critical gate 3 - e.g., "Validate willingness to pay premium vs. import pricing"]
4. [Critical gate 4 - e.g., "Confirm technical specifications match commercial requirements"]
5. [Critical gate 5 - e.g., "Identify 2-3 early adopter customers ready to commit to purchase"]

**Consider [Alternative Approach]:**
- [Alternative 1 - e.g., "Start with research/academic market (lower sales friction, higher margin tolerance)"]
- [Alternative 2 - e.g., "Partner with established distributor to access customer relationships"]
- [Alternative 3 - e.g., "Conduct paid pilot program to validate willingness to pay before scaling production"]
- [Alternative 4 - OPTIONAL]

### Bottom Line

**Technology Risk:** [Low / Medium / High]
[1-2 sentences justifying the technology risk assessment]

**Market Risk:** [Low / Medium / High]
[1-2 sentences justifying the market risk assessment]

**Recommendation:** [Clear, specific next step]

**Example:**
"Technology Risk: Low (TRL 4, validated in lab, clear technical roadmap, team has domain expertise)

Market Risk: High (no customer interviews, untested pricing, unvalidated demand, unclear willingness to pay premium)

**Recommendation:** PAUSE further technical development and production scale-up. Invest next 12 weeks in intensive customer discovery (20-30 interviews across all segments). Do not proceed with major capital investment until commercial validation strengthens to ≥3.5/5. Current desirability score would be ~2.0-2.5 based on weak validation."

## Section 12: APPENDIX - CUSTOMER DISCOVERY INTERVIEW GUIDE

### Interview Structure (45-60 minutes)

#### Phase 1: Opening (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Build rapport and set expectations

- Introduce yourself and purpose: "We're researching [domain] to understand challenges and needs"
- Set expectations: "This is research, not a sales pitch. We want to learn from your experience"
- Get permission to take notes or record
- Build rapport with warm-up question: "Tell me about your role and what you're working on"

#### Phase 2: Current State (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand their world before introducing your solution

Explore their current situation and practices:
1. "Walk me through how you currently [do the relevant task]"
2. "What tools or solutions are you using today?"
3. "How did you choose those solutions?"
4. "What's working well with your current approach?"
5. "What would you change if you could?"

#### Phase 3: Problem Validation (15 minutes)

**Purpose:** Validate problems and quantify pain intensity

Validate the problems and pain points:
1. "Tell me about a time when [problem] caused issues for you"
2. "How often does this problem occur?"
3. "What does this problem cost you?" (time, money, opportunity, reputation)
4. "What have you tried to solve this?"
5. "If you could wave a magic wand, what would the ideal solution look like?"

#### Phase 4: Pricing & Willingness to Pay (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Understand financial constraints and validate pricing assumptions

Understand financial constraints and decision factors:
1. "What's your budget for [category of solution]?"
2. "How do you make purchasing decisions for tools like this?"
3. "If a solution saved you [quantified benefit from Phase 3], what would that be worth?"
4. "What would make a solution too expensive to consider?"

#### Phase 5: Solution Validation (10 minutes)

**Purpose:** Introduce your approach AFTER understanding their needs

Introduce technology AFTER understanding their needs:
1. "We're exploring a solution that [brief description]. How does that sound?"
2. "Which of the problems we discussed would this address for you?"
3. "What concerns do you have about this approach?"
4. "If this were available today at $X, would you try it?"
5. "What would need to be true for you to switch from your current solution?"

#### Phase 6: Close (5 minutes)

**Purpose:** Get referrals and set up next steps

Next steps and relationship building:
1. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
2. "Would you be interested in testing an early version?"
3. "Can I follow up with you in [timeframe]?"

### Key Insights to Capture

Document these critical data points from every interview:

- **Pain Intensity:** How much does the problem cost them? (quantify in time, money, opportunity cost)
- **Current Solutions:** What do they use now? Satisfaction level (1-5 scale)?
- **Decision Criteria:** What factors matter most? Who decides? What's the approval process?
- **Willingness to Pay:** Specific price points, not just "interested" (test multiple price levels)
- **Objections:** Why might they NOT buy? (price, risk, implementation complexity, inertia)
- **Technical Requirements:** What exactly matters? (specs, integration, support, customization)
- **Timeline:** When do they make decisions? What's urgent vs. nice-to-have?
- **Alternatives Considered:** What else have they tried/considered? Why did they choose current solution?

### Interview Best Practices

1. **Listen More, Talk Less (80/20 rule)**
   - You should listen 80% of the time, talk 20%
   - Resist urge to pitch or explain your solution
   - Comfortable silence = they're thinking (don't fill it)

2. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**
   - "Tell me about..." not "Do you...?"
   - "How" and "Why" questions encourage stories
   - Avoid yes/no questions that close conversation

3. **Dig Deeper with Follow-Ups**
   - "Why is that?"
   - "Tell me more"
   - "Can you give me an example?"
   - "What else?"

4. **Listen for Problems, Not Solutions**
   - Don't pitch your solution until Phase 5
   - Understand their needs first
   - They'll often propose solutions (note it, but dig for underlying need)

5. **Validate with Specifics**
   - "That's interesting" ≠ validation
   - Get concrete: "How much would you pay?"
   - Ask for commitment: "Would you test this?"
   - Quantify everything possible

6. **Don't Sell, Learn**
   - Frame as research, not sales call
   - You're there to understand, not convince
   - Their honesty is more valuable than their politeness
   - Bad news early is good news (saves you from building wrong thing)

7. **End with Referrals**
   - Always ask: "Who else should I talk to?"
   - Warm introductions >> cold outreach
   - Build network systematically
   - Ask for 2-3 specific names

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Leading questions:** "Wouldn't it be great if...?" (plants ideas in their head)
- **Pitching too early:** Wait until Phase 5 to introduce your solution
- **Taking "nice" responses at face value:** "That sounds interesting" ≠ validation
- **Ignoring negative signals:** Dissatisfaction with status quo is valuable data
- **Not documenting immediately:** Write notes right after interview while fresh
- **Confirmation bias:** Hear what they actually say, not what you want to hear
- **Skipping pricing questions:** "Would you pay for this?" is critical validation
- **Talking more than listening:** If you're explaining, you're not learning

### Target Interview Segments

**Distribution Target:**
- [X] interviews with [Primary Requester Segment 1]
- [X] interviews with [Primary Requester Segment 2]
- [X] interviews with [Primary Requester Segment 3]
- [X] interviews with [Additional Segment - OPTIONAL]

**Total Target:** [20-30] interviews
**Success Target:** [20+] completed interviews (67% completion rate)

**Why target more than you need?**
- Some interviews won't materialize (no-shows, cancellations, reschedules)
- Some will be low-quality (wrong person, short duration, guarded responses)
- You need enough data to see patterns across segments, not just anecdotes
- 5+ per segment = patterns emerge, <5 = anecdotes only

**Interview Completion Timeline:** 8-12 weeks recommended

**Coordinator:** [Name and contact of person responsible for scheduling]

## IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **All character limits are strict** - No exceptions. Use character counters.
2. **Evidence-based assessment** - Facts over aspirations. Low validation scores are valuable signals.
3. **Honest gap identification** - Critical for assessment value and decision-making.
4. **Reliability ratings must be genuine** - Don't fabricate validation status.
5. **Each need must be distinct** - Test: "Could I satisfy one need without the other?"
6. **"Doing Nothing" is a real competitor** - If you can't articulate why status quo is painful, you don't have opportunity.
7. **Create all four outputs:** This markdown file + 3 professionally formatted DOCX files.
8. **File naming:** Use conventions specified in prompt file.
